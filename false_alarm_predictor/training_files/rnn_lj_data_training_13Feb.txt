LJ013-0019	loose had his instructions to cast away the ship on the first possible opportunity and from the time of his leaving liverpool	1

LJ021-0207	i am not for a return to that definition of liberty under which for many years a free people were being gradually regimented	1
LJ050-0086	under these criteria whether the case should be referred to the secret service depends on the existence of a previous history of mental instability	1

LJ018-0053	he whispered in the ear of the german pastor who attended him on the scaffold	1
LJ009-0145	and he seemed to suffer great inward agitation when the ordinary particularly alluded to the crime for the perpetration of which he stood condemned	1
LJ021-0136	we have passed through more than a year of education	1
LJ018-0005	the public mind was greatly agitated by the affair for several months the story of the murder must be pretty familiar to most of my readers	1
LJ006-0034	they attended early and late they mustered the prisoners examined into their condition	1
LJ019-0377	and it is not strange if they did not very frequently hand up the offenders to the reproof and correction of the secretary of state	1
LJ036-0091	and neither captain fritz nor any other officer can remember that oswald dramatically arose from his chair	1
LJ010-0135	yelled out three cheers to the populace whom he faced	1
LJ023-0029	we cannot delay one moment in making certain that our national government has power to carry through	1
LJ042-0018	on the other hand at least one person who knew oswald after his return thought that his defection had a more personal and psychological basis	1
LJ016-0222	it may be added that of late years the clothes in which a convict has suffered are invariably burnt	1
LJ043-0059	while it does not appear that he established any new relationships as a result of his investigation he did obtain a large picture of his father	1
LJ019-0211	it was urged that the area selected for purchase must be excessively costly to acquire and still quite inadequate for the city needs	1

LJ012-0123	within three months three new and most mysterious burglaries were committed at the west end all in houses adjoining each other	1
LJ003-0347	it was very desirable that there should be a more speedy removal of transports from newgate to the ships	1
LJ003-0312	the jailer should be required to visit every part and see every prisoner daily the chaplain should perform service visit the sick	1
LJ032-0202	two pictures were taken the commission has concluded that the rifle shown in these pictures is the same rifle which was found on the sixth floor of the depository building	1

LJ005-0219	female prisoners were still exposed to the full view of the males the netting in front of the gallery being perfectly useless as a screen	1
LJ044-0199	in retrospect his attempt to go to cuba or return to the soviet union may well have been oswalds last escape hatch	1
LJ008-0180	among the dead was a sailor lad whom no one knew	1
LJ004-0140	and the turnkey told mr buxton that the smell on first opening the door was enough to knock down a horse	1
LJ016-0029	even after williams had got out persons were disposed to disbelieve that the escape had been accomplished in the manner indicated	1
LJ026-0025	the important point to recognize is that these boundaries are artificial and that there are no scientific frontiers in nature	1

LJ026-0075	are dissolved by the sap in the leaves and elsewhere and thus may pass to every portion of the plant	1
LJ008-0232	a sound as if the ocean had suddenly broken through some ancient boundary against which its ever restless billows had for ages battered	1
LJ004-0088	as a remedy justices of the peace were empowered to provide materials for the setting of poor prisoners to work	1
LJ041-0171	and i remember his voice cracked as he said this he was definitely disturbed at what i had said and i didnt really think i had said that much	1
LJ011-0179	so that it might become the exclusive property of her husband whoever he might be	1

LJ015-0207	but the collusion and active assistance of employees of the railway carriers were indispensable and together	1
LJ018-0020	a desperate and deadly struggle must have taken place in the carriage and the stain of a bloody hand marked the door	1
LJ022-0198	we have in the darkest moments of our national trials retained our faith in our own ability to master our destiny	1
LJ003-0182	the tried and the untried young and old were herded together	1
LJ024-0108	this is the same group who during the campaign last fall tried to block the mandate of the people	1
LJ028-0519	or that the babylonian soldier stood confidently upon their summit and jeering at the persian army encamped below shouted	1
LJ009-0171	gradually the application of capital punishment became more and more restricted and was soon the penalty for murder alone	1
LJ016-0362	and the great outside world shared in the completion of the sacrifice	1
LJ016-0026	managed to get away in the very same spot where his namesake had nine years before so miserably failed	1
LJ048-0284	this is the salutary goal to which the secret service regulation is directed	1
LJ003-0181	there was a masters side for females who could pay the usual fees but they associated with the rest in the one narrow yard common to all	1
LJ048-0027	nowhere during the course of this investigation or the information that came to us from other agencies was there any indication of a potential for violence on his part	1
LJ028-0303	i think they will believe my words and entrust me with a command of troops thou on thy part must wait	1

LJ026-0130	and may thus be easily transported to all parts of the plant	1
LJ010-0076	in this way he formed the acquaintance of watson and others with whom he was arraigned for treasonable practices and imprisoned	1
LJ042-0010	it appears that personal and psychological factors were also involved	1
LJ019-0183	provided it was henceforth used only for untried prisoners suggested that newgate should be entirely reconstructed and the new building adopted as a model	1
LJ043-0182	in any event the walker incident indicates that in spite of the belief among those who knew him that he was apparently not dangerous	1
LJ020-0097	you will not relish it but take it all the same to appease the empty discontented stomach	1
LJ032-0265	each man testified that he thought he could detect the outline of a rifle in the blanket even though the blanket was empty	1
LJ003-0152	it was the only way to escape the horrors the distress penury and rags of the common yards	1
LJ035-0111	truly was probably correct in stating that the west elevator was on the fifth floor when he looked up the elevator shaft from the first floor	1

LJ002-0231	there was no distinct place for the female debtors who lived in the same galleries as the men	1

LJ022-0150	to eliminate so far as humanly possible the kinds of unfair practices by selfish minorities which unfortunately	1

LJ018-0377	conviction was obtained through the evidence of the steward and two of the least culpable of the crew	1
LJ016-0260	has already been quoted again the concourse of people collected in front of newgate to witness the execution	1

LJ013-0144	one of the owners had met her at deal but the captain had already absconded with the packages of precious stones in his pocket	1
LJ043-0024	even though it appears that they may have left oswald a few days before it seems that he resisted the move as best he could	1
LJ033-0053	only if disassembled could the rifle fit into the paper bag found near the window from which the shots were fired	1

LJ022-0058	while our present and projected expenditures for work relief are wholly within the reasonable limits of our national credit resources	1
LJ016-0347	had undoubtedly a solemn impressive effect upon those outside	1
LJ014-0147	shaking her clenched and manacled hands in the officers faces	1
LJ048-0010	stressed also the decision by the department of state that oswald should be permitted to return to the united states	1
LJ048-0162	except for inauguration or other parades involving foreign dignitaries accompanied by the president in washington	1
LJ013-0170	the fresh marks of violence upon the door had evidently been made inside and not from outside	1
LJ038-0160	he asked me what were the people gathering around on the corner for and i told him that the president was supposed to pass that morning	1
LJ010-0125	and suffered in the usual way in front of newgate with the additional penalty of decapitation as traitors after they had been hanged	1
LJ041-0004	after his return to new orleans oswald was teased at school because of the northern accent which he had acquired	1
LJ018-0204	where it had lain was a yawning gulf or trap sufficient to do for the whole body of police engaged in the capture	1
LJ008-0090	it was still the custom to offer warm encouragement or bitter disapproval according to the character and antecedents of the sufferer	1
LJ010-0270	exactly tallied with that of the deformed person wanted for the assault on the queen	1
LJ016-0383	all almost without exception sleep soundly at night except the first after sentence	1
LJ050-0118	since these agencies are already obliged constantly to evaluate the activities of such groups	1
LJ045-0236	he admitted nothing that would damage him but discussed other matters quite freely	1
LJ009-0131	boast to their companions after the service that they had wiped their eyes during the thanksgiving to make the ordinary believe they had been crying	1
LJ030-0159	since the camera operates at a speed of eighteen point three frames per second	1
LJ049-0074	their actions demonstrate that the president and the nation can expect courage and devotion to duty from the agents of the secret service	1
LJ003-0102	mr buxton in the work already quoted instances another grievous case of the horrors of indiscriminate association in newgate	1
LJ021-0081	with the confidence that we are definitely rebuilding our political and economic system on the lines laid down by the new deal	1
LJ004-0235	indeed the best consequences followed from the removal of irons the prisoners were much better disposed there were no riots and fewer disturbances	1
LJ045-0218	thoughts of his personal difficulties must have been at least partly on his mind when he went to irving on thursday night and told his wife that he was lonely	1
LJ006-0033	the ink was barely dry upon their letters of appointment before they appeared at newgate and commenced a searching investigation	1
LJ028-0371	then the world metropolis stripped of most of its population became a mere village	1
LJ023-0053	it is the american people themselves who expect the third horse to pull in unison with the other two	1
LJ003-0191	strange and inconceivable delay occurred in carrying out the extreme sentence	1
LJ022-0184	not by a few private banking institutions but by a body with public prestige and authority	1
LJ038-0237	the commission confirmed by comparison with other photographs that these were indeed photographs of the rear of walkers house	1
LJ014-0153	after this until the day of execution she recovered her spirits and displayed reckless effrontery	1
LJ042-0170	there are two great representatives of power in the world	1
LJ008-0018	extended upon a plank on the top of an open cart in his clothes and fettered	1
LJ013-0050	but among the charges on the estate he left	1
LJ043-0157	answer yes question and you said it was not a good idea to keep this book answer yes	1
LJ045-0044	many of the people with whom the oswalds became acquainted after their arrival in the united states thought that marina oswald had married her husband primarily in the hope	1
LJ005-0214	some reforms had certainly been introduced such as the abolition of irons already referred to and the establishment of male and female infirmaries	1
LJ002-0228	the committee on jails reported that quote although the house of the warden looked into the court	1
LJ004-0210	there was a prison laundry too where all the prisoners linen was regularly washed	1
LJ049-0178	should have constituted a sufficient basis to warn the secret service of the oswald risk	1
LJ021-0024	all present new questions for the solution of which the old reliance upon the free action of individual wills appears quite inadequate	1
LJ046-0139	to refer all communications on identified existing cases and in addition	1
LJ004-0135	twenty men slept on eight straw beds with sixteen rugs amongst them and a piece of timber for a bolster	1
LJ045-0143	and use it against him as had been done in new orleans	1
LJ010-0013	forgeries committed systematically and for long periods as in the case of fauntleroy	1
LJ003-0324	gaming of all sorts should be peremptorily forbidden under heavy pains and penalties	1
LJ019-0180	his letter to the corporation under date fourth june	1
LJ013-0254	and evidence was given of close relation between good and a third woman a girl named butcher residing at woolwich	1
LJ044-0133	he had not found another job his wife was expecting their second child in october and there was concern about the cost which would be involved	1
LJ004-0230	it was found that shackles might be safely dispensed with even in the case of the most desperate characters	1
LJ007-0025	there were frequent quarrels and fights shoes and other missiles were freely bandied about	1
LJ050-0263	it will continue to rely in many respects upon the greater resources of the office of science and technology and other agencies	1
LJ010-0309	during these numerous and trying difficulties it is mr fauntleroy who speaks	1
LJ026-0033	be either included in or excluded from either	1
LJ008-0202	those who had hired apartments spent the night in them keeping up their courage with liquids and cigars	1
LJ019-0367	and with the warning a copy of the particular defects and allegations was to be sent to the local authority	1
LJ050-0276	as has been pointed out the commission has not resolved all the proposals which could be made the commission nevertheless is confident that	1
LJ025-0003	the facts dealing with the physiology of organisms the activities associated with that which we call life	1
LJ018-0077	although manacled he managed to get a pistol from his chest and load it	1
LJ014-0151	later her mood changed to abject despair	1
LJ049-0127	agencies other than the secret service have become involved in phases of the overall problem of protecting our national leaders	1
LJ015-0055	next morning they only just saved the train to town and left sir john behind on the platform but he subsequently surrendered himself	1
LJ026-0107	dissolved in water the sugar is transported down delicate tubes chiefly in the growing bark region of the stem	1
LJ020-0030	sift into it white flour meal and salt and stir up well while dry	1
LJ006-0237	a lad named matthew white has had a wound in his eye by a bone thrown at him which very nearly destroyed vision	1
LJ042-0145	in general our family life began to deteriorate after we arrived in america	1
LJ022-0036	did you ever stop to think that there are after all only two positions in the nation	1
LJ006-0019	the first named had long been an active philanthropist devoting himself more particularly to the reformation of juvenile criminals	1
LJ013-0059	there were two separate affairs	1
LJ005-0198	in another borough with a population of ten thousand the prison was of the same dimensions	1
LJ004-0060	you have no right he says addressing the authorities to subject a prisoner to suffering from cold	1
LJ038-0267	unless the missile or cartridge case can be identified as coming from a particular weapon to the exclusion of all others	1
LJ018-0289	when all was ready bidwell first refreshed his credit at the bank of england as well as disarmed suspicion	1
LJ038-0085	a full discussion of oswalds detention and interrogation is presented in chapter five of this report	1
LJ014-0166	faded in my mind before the atrocious bearing looks and language of the assembled spectators	1
LJ047-0187	it was then my plan to interview marina oswald in detail concerning both herself and her husbands background question	1
LJ016-0305	already the urgent necessity for abolishing public executions had been brought before the house of commons by mr hibbert	1
LJ005-0142	occupying barely three hundred ninety feet lineal	1
LJ022-0098	of making full use of existing employment services and to assist people engaged in relief work	1
LJ001-0162	even allowing the necessity for a very low price but any improvement must be based on showing openly that the cheap article is cheap	1
LJ005-0235	last and worst of all the arrangements for keeping the condemned prisoners between sentence and execution were more than unsatisfactory	1
LJ003-0089	occasionally the transports made themselves so useful in the jail that they were passed over	1
LJ019-0024	nor must it be overlooked that this the first model prison although obtained at a considerable cost became actually what its name implied	1
LJ035-0126	claimed that within about one minute following the shots she ran from a window on the south side of the fourth floor	1
LJ042-0202	it has turned itself into the traditional lever of a foreign power to overthrow the government of the united states	1
LJ002-0006	but it was almost always in excess of the accommodation available and there were times when the place was full to overflowing	1
LJ027-0039	both adaptations for pumping blood	1
LJ006-0210	drink in more or less unlimited quantities was still to be had	1
LJ035-0046	i was coming out this one on the second floor and i dont know i was kind of sweeping this area as i come up i was looking from right to left	1
LJ008-0210	the crowd began to congregate in and about the old bailey	1
LJ041-0034	started expounding the communist doctrine and saying that he was highly interested in communism that communism was the only way of life for the worker et cetera	1
LJ033-0189	enabled the commission to conclude that the bag was made from these materials	1
LJ028-0440	possibly along the terraces of the walls or upon the stages of some lofty temple tower	1
LJ046-0106	largely measures taken by the secret service is considered	1
LJ013-0168	that lord william russell had committed suicide was at once declared impossible	1
LJ009-0163	in the same year capital punishment was further restricted and ceased to be the legal sentence for coining	1
LJ041-0046	there is evidence that oswald was greatly influenced in his decision to join the marines by the fact that his brother robert had done so	1
LJ006-0005	just before the public mind was first awakened to the need for thorough reform	1
LJ043-0138	as indicated in chapter four oswald had been planning his attack on general walker for at least one and perhaps as much as two months	1
LJ046-0006	during this same period there were three other attacks on the life of a president	1
LJ029-0206	another reaction to the impending visit hostile to the president came to a head shortly before his arrival	1
LJ040-0103	an indication of the nature of lees character at this time was provided in the spring of nineteen fifty	1
LJ021-0112	or to prevent destructive price cutting which many business organizations have insisted were necessary	1
LJ036-0030	about two blocks later a woman asked to get off to make a one oclock train at union station	1
LJ026-0139	it is probable that new leaves and new tissues generally are always formed in part from this reserve starch	1
LJ045-0062	he made no attempt to help her and there are other indications that he did not want her to learn that language	1
LJ046-0102	this section considers first the means used to locate potential sources of danger to the president in time to take appropriate precautions	1
LJ027-0052	these principles of homology are essential to a correct interpretation of the facts of morphology	1
LJ047-0068	and his recommendation was accepted he decided however not to interview marina oswald at that time and merely determined	1
LJ005-0264	inspectors of prisons should be appointed who should visit all the prisons from time to time and report to the secretary of state	1
LJ032-0077	among other identification cards in oswalds wallet at the time of his arrest were a selective service notice of classification	1
LJ005-0009	many thus led in procession were in a shocking condition of dirt and misery frequently nearly naked and often bearing upon them	1
LJ038-0092	oswald provided little information during his questioning	1
LJ037-0260	that he was seen running along jefferson boulevard that a jacket was found under a car in a lot adjoining jefferson boulevard	1
LJ013-0231	where is it asked the governor	1
LJ008-0080	she was immediately tied by the neck to an iron bolt fixed near the top of the stake	1
LJ028-0378	even the shepherds ceased to graze their sheep there and the wandering arabs	1
LJ046-0019	in this part of its inquiry the commission has had full access to a major study of all phases of protective activities	1
LJ008-0086	a great concourse of people attended on this melancholy occasion	1
LJ002-0206	dissolute habits prevailed on all sides drunkenness was universal gambling perpetual	1
LJ018-0174	and the prominent part he played secured for him on conviction the heaviest sentence of the law	1
LJ028-0271	now when a year and seven months had passed darius and his army were quite wearied out finding that they could not anyhow take the city	1
LJ007-0161	drink gaming obscene and blasphemous language utter idleness the almost unrestricted admission of money and luxuries	1
LJ004-0194	no irons were worn except as a punishment	1
LJ025-0144	one of which is able to affect the other by means of the communication so established	1
LJ019-0186	seeing that since the establishment of the central criminal court newgate received prisoners for trial from several counties	1
LJ018-0214	as the case must still be well remembered by the present generation it will be necessary to give here only the briefest summary	1
LJ005-0087	female prisoners were in all cases to be under the charge of female officers	1
LJ038-0017	attracted by the sound of the sirens mrs postal stepped out of the box office and walked to the curb	1
LJ010-0219	while one stood over the fire with the papers another stood with lighted torch to fire the house	1
LJ026-0128	for it is here that oxidation occurs and the need for a renewal of matter and energy consequently arises	1
LJ046-0086	is dependent to a considerable extent upon the degree of contact with the general public desired by the president	1
LJ005-0275	religious worship and instruction as absolutely necessary for preventing contamination	1
LJ021-0125	it was natural that the workers should seek and obtain a statutory declaration of their constitutional right	1
LJ028-0284	when he found that darius did indeed value it highly he considered further with himself how he might make the deed his own and be the man to take babylon	1
LJ006-0246	on another occasion a young man who was being violently teased seized a knife and stabbed his tormentor in the back	1
LJ039-0047	marina oswald speculated that the incident may have been unrelated to an actual threat	1
LJ026-0146	they are absorbed by the circulating liquids and carried to the eliminating organs lungs and kidneys chiefly for elimination	1
LJ006-0004	but this digression was necessary in order to present a more complete picture of the state of jails in the early part of the present century	1
LJ010-0221	another letter directed oxford to attend an extraordinary meeting of young england	1
LJ022-0027	the most difficult place in the world to get a clear open perspective of the country as a whole is washington	1
LJ045-0232	oswald was overbearing and arrogant throughout much of the time between his arrest and his own death	1
LJ013-0074	a third similar fraud to the amount of two thousand pounds was also brought to light	1
LJ010-0232	he could not plead insanity like his predecessor and no attempt was made at his trial to prove him of unsound mind	1
LJ039-0207	although all of the shots were a few inches high and to the right of the target	1
LJ008-0259	and of their demeanor after sentence until the last penalty was paid	1
LJ010-0259	a deformed lad among the crowd was seen to present a pistol at her majestys carriage	1
LJ021-0152	and to experiment for a reasonable time with measures suitable to civilize our industrial civilization	1
LJ005-0004	unless they could afford to pay for a vehicle out of their own funds	1
LJ028-0375	slowly the few remaining walls fell and were buried in their own ruins	1
LJ030-0181	turning to his right in the direction of the noise kellerman heard the president say	1
LJ019-0042	these were either satisfied with a makeshift and modified existing buildings without close regard to their suitability or for a long time did nothing at all	1
LJ047-0011	and the assistant to the director in charge of all investigative activities under the director and associate director in addition	1
LJ011-0232	it must not be imagined that although highway robbery was now nearly extinct and felonious outrages in the streets were rare	1
LJ028-0021	again long before the stars have been scattered by the morning sun you are on your way	1
LJ016-0356	broke down at the supreme moment before the horror of the stillness the awful impressiveness of the scene in which he was the principal actor	1
LJ038-0112	as previously indicated marina oswald testified that she took the two pictures with her husbands imperial reflex camera	1
LJ018-0063	he had led a wild life had left his native land and enlisted first in the french army in algeria	1
LJ046-0043	as commander in chief of the armed forces he must maintain ultimate authority over the development and disposition of our military power	1
LJ009-0082	except the clergyman and the burglar the former of whom is still rolled up at the bottom of the condemned pew	1
LJ047-0002	chapter eight the protection of the president part two	1
LJ033-0187	however the complete identity of characteristics between the paper and tape in the bag found on the sixth floor	1
LJ003-0323	drunkenness if it ever occurred should be visited with severe punishment	1
LJ011-0221	and was brought from newgate at his own request to oppose the second reading of the bill	1
LJ008-0284	nothing could be more strongly marked than the contrast between the ultimate destiny of different individuals all abiding the same awful doom	1
LJ003-0119	this was carried out by putting the criminals head through the legs of a chair and stretching out his arms and tying them to the legs	1
LJ047-0130	advised the bureau that oswald was unknown in such circles	1
LJ012-0087	should be introduced into the building and secreted there during the night to accomplish the robbery	1
LJ043-0131	as a result oswald was not hired	1
LJ001-0006	and it is worth mention in passing that as an example of fine typography	1
LJ039-0018	he also said that he would use the pistol if the opportunity arose	1
LJ039-0056	the commission considered whether oswald using his own rifle	1
LJ013-0242	this increased when the officer accompanied by two others a neighbor and a bailiff entered one of the stables	1
LJ007-0120	some to the infirmary many more to the governors house	1
LJ009-0133	the outside public continued to be excluded from the newgate chapel on the day the condemned sermon was preached	1
LJ047-0229	even if he had recalled that oswalds place of employment was on the presidents route	1
LJ003-0072	that some other and less mixed prison should be used for the confinement of persons convicted of libels but this suggestion was ignored	1
LJ014-0035	in a lonely part of hampstead	1
LJ021-0090	suited to the needs of the next phase which is in turn a period of preparation for legislation which will determine its permanent form	1
LJ050-0142	directed its field representatives to send a form request for intelligence information to all local	1
LJ014-0305	so enormous were his transactions that they often affected the markets and caused great fluctuations in prices	1
LJ010-0301	he had entered the house as clerk in eighteen hundred	1
LJ024-0136	third because it will provide a series of federal courts willing to enforce the constitution as written	1
LJ042-0141	she added that while he helped her as he had done before he became more of a recluse that quote	1
LJ023-0081	asserted a power to veto laws passed by the congress and state legislatures in complete disregard of this original limitation	1
LJ039-0140	soon after oswald returned from the soviet union	1
LJ024-0132	i am in favor of action through legislation	1
LJ007-0159	forced and constant intercourse with the most depraved individuals of his own class	1
LJ018-0298	time was clearly an important factor in the fraud hence the bills were sent forward in quick succession	1
LJ004-0242	some attempt was made to reduce the overcrowding on the recommendation of the house of commons committee of eighteen eighteen but this applied only a partial remedy	1
LJ003-0283	it was not strange therefore that the inmates of newgate should turn their unoccupied brains and idle hands to all manner of mischief	1
LJ033-0182	since the depository normally used approximately one roll of paper every three working days	1
LJ006-0006	i shall now return to the great jail of the city of london and give a more detailed account of its condition and inner life	1
LJ019-0124	thinking perhaps that prisoners so well disposed would cheerfully remain in jail of their own accord	1
LJ043-0102	it is possible that his immediate supervisor noticed the newspaper at that time because his attention had otherwise been drawn more directly to oswald	1
LJ018-0184	one narrow escape he had however before he abandoned his old business	1
LJ019-0065	better industrial results were obtained from it and instruction in trades was easier and prisoners were more likely to leave jail	1
LJ003-0130	his wife visited him in newgate and wrote a pitiable account of the state in which she found her husband	1
LJ038-0138	when asked about the curtain rod story oswald lied again	1
LJ016-0021	although his execution was imminent a surgeon attended to his wounds and he was carried more dead than alive to the scaffold	1
LJ010-0021	the credulity of investors the unscrupulous dishonesty of bankers	1
LJ009-0269	his chest heaved and it was evident that his struggle was a fearful one	1
LJ046-0233	it made little effort to identify factors in the activities of an individual	1
LJ027-0038	between the heart of an insect and the heart of a vertebrate animal	1
LJ004-0171	was by a kind of chimney which the prisoners kept hermetically sealed and which had never been opened in the memory of the turnkey	1
LJ034-0027	depository employees were laying a new floor at the west end and transferring books from the west to the east end of the building	1
LJ045-0123	to some extent after his fair play for cuba committee activities had become known he exaggerated their concern for him	1
LJ032-0137	the lifting had been so complete in this case that there was no trace of the print on the rifle itself when it was examined by latona	1
LJ046-0215	any information indicating the possibility of an attempt against the person or safety of the president	1
LJ029-0155	as the date for the presidents visit approached	1
LJ035-0146	saw him walk through the clerical office on the second floor toward the door leading to the front stairway	1
LJ042-0154	while it was apparently intended for publication in the united states and is in many respects critical of certain aspects of life in the soviet union	1
LJ038-0145	in one interview he told fritz that the only sack he carried to work that day	1
LJ043-0136	demonstrating once again his propensity to act dramatically and in this instance violently in furtherance of his beliefs	1
LJ024-0141	you who know me will accept my solemn assurance that in a world in which democracy is under attack	1
LJ043-0063	not only caused him difficulties in his employment relations but they also provided him with excuses for employment failures	1
LJ038-0130	as one entitled to receive mail	1
LJ003-0125	the evidence was invariably sufficient to convict and the judge never hesitated to inflict the heaviest penalties	1
LJ049-0107	or who hold important governmental posts	1
LJ042-0103	oswald apparently resented the exercise of authority over him and the better treatment afforded to communist party officials	1
LJ013-0127	suspicion fell at length upon ashley who was seen to handle the forks and spoons at table in a strange manner	1
LJ006-0292	male prisoners carried coal into the female prison when they saw and could speak or pass letters to the female prisoners	1
LJ003-0054	an imperfect attempt at classification was however made in eighteen twelve and a yard was as far as possible set apart for the untried	1
LJ049-0009	when president and mrs kennedy shook hands with members of the public along the fences surrounding the reception area they were closely guarded by secret service agents	1
LJ016-0382	many cling still to life expecting much from the intercession of friends or the humanitarianism of the age	1
LJ019-0041	other jurisdictions were less prompt to recognize their responsibilities the city of london among the number as i shall presently show at length	1
LJ050-0012	through an assistant secretary whose duties also include the direct supervision of the bureau of the mint	1
LJ008-0035	were told that the plan had been well considered and would be persevered in	1
LJ045-0105	she testified that she told him quote	1
LJ003-0246	sometimes the wearer was declared medically unfit or he obtained release by long good conduct	1
LJ003-0282	many years were to elapse before these objections should be fairly met and universally overcome	1
LJ015-0043	this went on for some time and might never have been discovered had some good stroke of luck provided any of the partners	1
LJ015-0230	after this nothing remained but to wait for some occasion when the amount transmitted would be sufficient to justify the risks of robbery	1
LJ050-0017	to be able to provide effective continuing supervision	1
LJ003-0087	these often remained in newgate for six months sometimes a year in some cases longer	1
LJ012-0230	shortly before the day fixed for execution bishop made a full confession the bulk of which bore the impress of truth	1
LJ041-0193	i think he would then throw himself entirely on the other thing he also wanted which was the image in history	1
LJ001-0168	on the whole a small book should be printed on paper which is as thin as may be without being transparent	1
LJ004-0018	generally through the personal activity of influential and benevolent local magnates but the true principles of prison construction	1
LJ021-0166	we must make it a national principle that we will not tolerate a large army of unemployed and that we will arrange our national economy	1
LJ017-0281	as the first to appear would have some time to wait for his fellows a difficult and painful ordeal	1
LJ005-0259	it was laid down as a first and indispensable principle that uniformity of discipline should prevail everywhere	1
LJ026-0049	in turn these will be compared for the animal and the plant	1
LJ004-0080	because they are not specified in his sentence he is therefore entitled to a wholesome atmosphere	1
LJ039-0213	so that if you aimed with this weapon as it actually was received at the laboratory it would not be necessary to take any lead whatsoever	1
LJ008-0269	already the severity of our criminal code and the number of capital felonies upon the statute book had brought a reaction	1
LJ022-0023	the overwhelming majority of people in this country know how to sift the wheat from the chaff in what they hear and what they read	1
LJ006-0139	nobody interfered with them or regulated their conduct they might get drunk when so disposed and did so frequently alone or in company	1
LJ034-0016	behind these boxes was another carton placed on the floor on which a man sitting	1
LJ044-0147	and in late june or early july he told his wife that he wanted to return to the soviet union with her she said that he was extremely upset	1
LJ012-0211	mr partridge was sent for and he with some of the students soon decided that the corpse had not died a natural death	1
LJ041-0160	i certainly dont i dont think with any kind of formal argument you could have shaken that conviction and that is why i say irrevocable	1
LJ050-0009	disclosed by the commissions investigation other measures should be taken as well to improve the overall operation of the secret service	1
LJ043-0142	oswald posed for two pictures	1
LJ041-0064	daniel powers another marine who was stationed with oswald for part of his marine career	1

LJ045-0037	after his recent rebuffs in mexico city	1
LJ040-0044	oswald apparently started reading about communism when he was about fifteen	1

LJ013-0024	at a place called the silver keys he ran the ship on the reef	1
LJ048-0119	the only systematic supervision of the activities of the advance agent	1
LJ021-0131	is not fully supporting the recovery effort of his government	1
LJ021-0206	whatever they need to have done but cannot do at all or cannot do so well for themselves in their separate and individual capacities	1
LJ006-0071	no doubt the governor for the time being mr cope was in a great measure to blame for all this and for the want of proper classification	1
LJ033-0120	which he believed was where the bag reached when it was laid on the seat with one edge against the door	1
LJ028-0513	should you cross the river to search for the western inner wall you would find but a small fragment of it	1

LJ002-0027	and this number did not include the debtors a numerous class who were still committed to newgate pending the completion of the white cross street prison	1
LJ006-0126	had been known to employ threats declaring that he was often consulted by the governor as to a prisoners character	1
LJ019-0033	some jurisdictions greatly to their credit strove at once to follow the lead of the central authority	1
LJ028-0332	once more however he waited till the interval appointed had gone by and then leading the troops to the place where the four thousand were	1
LJ043-0055	he never saw or communicated with her in any way again until she came to see him after the assassination	1
LJ015-0157	during the days of his prosperity he was a governor of christs hospital	1
LJ003-0068	the man guilty of a common assault found himself side by side with the fraudulent or others who had attempted abominable crimes	1
LJ043-0095	he did not seem to be able to make the accommodations necessary when people work under such conditions and as a result	1
LJ038-0058	officer ray hawkins said	1
LJ035-0125	victoria adams who worked on the fourth floor of the depository building	1
LJ019-0156	unless the guilty prisoner was given up the whole ward was punished either by the exclusion of visitors or the deprivation of fire	1
LJ033-0169	it would be the thickness of both the paper and the tape the color under various lighting conditions of both the paper and the tape	1
LJ003-0186	only when the order of execution came down were those about to suffer placed apart in one of the rooms in the arcade of the middle ward	1
LJ018-0230	after reading it and finding this unfavorable to himself he resolved to carry out his deliberate plan	1
LJ035-0100	in the few seconds which elapsed while baker and truly ran from the first to the second floor	1
LJ009-0123	could any one knowing the late situation of the kneeling men looking as they do at the empty pew	1
LJ002-0017	trustworthy evidence is forthcoming to the effect that these high figures were constantly maintained for many months at a time	1
LJ042-0026	whatever oswalds reasons for going to the soviet union might have been however there can be little doubt that his desire to go was quite strong	1
LJ022-0045	therefore let us keep our minds on two or three simple essential facts in connection with this problem of unemployment	1
LJ014-0176	his determined addiction to evil courses had led to his being cast off by his family	1
LJ022-0081	funds allotted for each project should be actually and promptly spent and not held over until later years	1
LJ023-0065	they gave to the congress the ample broad powers to levy taxes	1
LJ016-0369	upon them devolved the painful duty of cutting down the body and preparing for the inquest	1
LJ038-0065	it is unlikely that any of the police officers referred to oswald as a suspect in the assassination	1
LJ022-0180	wise public policy however requires not only that banking be safe	1
LJ013-0134	and it was contended that these with the files were used to alter the marks on the plate	1
LJ019-0046	was the variety of views as regards the discipline to be introduced in these new prisons the time was one	1
LJ022-0088	they will be sent to an allotment division composed of representatives of the more important governmental agencies	1
LJ048-0129	in view of the constant change in the nature of threats to the president and the diversity of the dangers which may arise in the various cities within the united states	1
LJ046-0181	and who do not have a fixed place of residence members of the white house detail of the secret service have copies of this album	1
LJ004-0217	the old haphazard system by which meat was issued in bulk	1
LJ021-0073	this is because of the establishment of fair competitive standards and because of relief from unfair competition	1
LJ008-0181	he had his pockets filled with bread and cheese and it was generally supposed that he had come a long distance to see the fatal show	1
LJ043-0176	if the attack had succeeded and oswald had been caught the pictures showing him with his rifle	1
LJ028-0268	mounting upon the battlements that crowned their walls they insulted and jeered at darius and his mighty host	1
LJ039-0010	she had failed to mention the incident when she was asked whether oswald had ever expressed any hostility	1
LJ019-0048	a new and still imperfectly understood science had arisen	1
LJ043-0099	it appears that his discharge was hastened by the fact that he brought a russian language newspaper to work	1
LJ005-0257	during which time a host of witnesses were examined and the committee presented three separate reports	1
LJ005-0140	at the new prison clerkenwell which had become the principal reception jail of middlesex and so took all the untried	1

LJ016-0334	unusual precautions were taken upon this occasion as some fresh outrage was apprehended	1
LJ012-0233	according to the confession death had been inflicted by drowning in a well whereas the medical evidence all pointed to violence	1

LJ008-0088	as many spectators as ever thronged to see the dreadful show	1
LJ031-0220	during the autopsy examination federal agents brought the surgeons three pieces of bone recovered from elm street and the presidential automobile	1
LJ006-0114	they bought their offices from one another and were thus considered to have a vested interest in them	1
LJ046-0088	to operate in a sort of vacuum isolated from the general public and behind impregnable barriers	1
LJ009-0268	through the improper adjustment of the rope his sufferings were prolonged for five minutes	1
LJ044-0236	it is unlikely that a reasoning person would plan to attempt to travel from dallas texas to cuba	1
LJ038-0241	also seen in the picture is the fence on which walkers assailant apparently rested the rifle	1
LJ045-0017	this meeting preceded by one day the attack on a e stevenson at the united nations day meeting at which he spoke	1

LJ016-0225	which his predecessors were not and who were paid their wages over the gate to obviate the necessity for letting them enter	1
LJ011-0004	once he ran a narrow risk of being found out	1
LJ016-0277	this is proved by contemporary accounts especially one graphic and realistic article which appeared in the times	1
LJ048-0197	i then told the officers that their primary duty was traffic and crowd control and that they should be alert for any persons who might attempt to throw anything	1
LJ012-0282	this wrapped up in a silk handkerchief	1
LJ038-0027	detective paul l bentley rushed to the balcony and told the projectionist to turn up the house lights	1
LJ024-0034	what do they mean by the words packing the court	1
LJ001-0142	modern printers generally overdo the whites in the spacing a defect probably forced on them by the characterless quality of the letters	1
LJ007-0139	again the discipline commonly deemed inseparable from every place of durance was entirely wanting	1
LJ044-0001	report of the presidents commission on the assassination of president kennedy	1
LJ013-0035	while lying in newgate awaiting removal to the convict ship both prisoners made full confessions	1
LJ050-0022	a formal and thorough description of the responsibilities of the advance agent is now in preparation by the service	1

LJ016-0250	it may however be remarked that the wisdom of appointing any regular hangman is very open to question	1
LJ021-0028	it was in this spirit thus described by secretary root	1
LJ013-0032	mate carpenter and crew were eager to disavow complicity and voluntarily gave information	1
LJ045-0187	there is of course no way to determine the degree to which he was committed to his plan at that time	1
LJ002-0092	the two yards were adjoining that for the common side much the largest	1
LJ028-0289	for he cut off his own nose and ears and then clipping his hair close and flogging himself with a scourge	1
LJ011-0275	there he was seated on some sort of wooden bench and securely fastened	1
LJ003-0278	insuperable difficulties were still supposed to stand in the way of any general employment of prisoners at their trades	1
LJ029-0066	no one else was identified to the secret service through local inquiry as potentially dangerous	1
LJ005-0078	but shall also tend more effectually to preserve the health	1
LJ033-0011	fiber and paper analyses linking oswald and the assassination weapon to this bag	1
LJ006-0303	this girl had been first engaged on account of the extra work entailed by certain prisoners	1
LJ005-0286	still under the borough corporations the commons committee gave it as their opinion that they were in a deplorable state	1
LJ022-0072	through the most comprehensive work plan in the history of the nation	1
LJ028-0279	after which he commanded his servants to tell no one what had come to pass while he himself pondered the matter	1
LJ001-0176	because the modern practice is to disregard the relation between the printing and the ornament altogether	1
LJ050-0109	since the assassination the service has recognized that these relationships must be far more formal	1
LJ025-0007	so much so as to require discussion in different treatises	1
LJ008-0236	coiled up on the floor of the scaffold like a serpent the hangmans rope	1
LJ014-0327	the owners of the latter would then issue a second set of warrants on these goods in total ignorance of the fact that they were already pledged	1
LJ045-0036	while those considerations no doubt had an effect on oswalds attitude toward his family it would seem that the need for support and sympathy	1
LJ018-0026	showed how greatly the publicity and wide dissemination of the news regarding murder facilitate the detection of crime	1
LJ019-0171	another custom which had led to disorder was abolished	1
LJ019-0009	or to insist upon the construction of prisons on the most approved plan	1
LJ019-0174	it was less prompt apparently in dealing with structural alterations and improvements	1
LJ047-0186	i can now afford to wait until new orleans forwarded the necessary papers to me to show me i now had all the information	1
LJ037-0172	even though only four bullets were recovered	1
LJ022-0130	it is time to provide a smashing answer for those cynical men who say that a democracy cannot be honest and efficient	1
LJ007-0096	it was high time that the unsatisfactory state of the law as regards the treatment of criminal lunatics should be remedied	1
LJ014-0298	strange to say a second suicide occurred in newgate the same night	1
LJ043-0183	oswald did not lack the determination and other traits required	1
LJ046-0123	for bizarre reasons or by writing or in some other way attempting to communicate with him in a threatening or abusive manner	1
LJ021-0008	we are bringing order out of the old chaos	1
LJ035-0194	approximately fifteen men worked in the warehouse and truly noticed that oswald was not among those being questioned	1
LJ038-0294	he indicated that he wanted more people in the vicinity at the time of the attempt so that his arrival and departure would not attract great attention	1
LJ009-0252	on the scaffold he made a violent attempt to loosen his bonds and succeeded in getting his hands free	1
LJ045-0020	in any event the commission has been unable to find any credible evidence that oswald had direct contact or association with	1
LJ009-0152	the crowd outside newgate on the day of execution has already been described but there was also a select gathering of distinguished visitors within the jail	1
