it is no use our dreaming about these items
furthermore as regional funds covering this area do not include transport infrastructure and the funds available bear no relation to the likely cost of the project they cannot be used to finance the project either
but i will be open to help all those member states all those regions that face problems because there are many possibilities available in the rural development policy
the draft under discussion for the last fifteen years must in our view include the three key elements which mrs ghilardotti has already presented and which were not fully accepted by the council after first reading
it goes without saying that the intention here is to achieve a balanced relationship between flexibility and security on the european labour markets
moreover parliament has improved the commissions proposal by setting out the ways in which the aid given will be annually reviewed and precisely how primary and secondary aid will be monitored and as in previous amendments that i tabled in the house i believe that this will guarantee the prices of potable alcohol as well as an annual minimum distillation volume of fifteen million hectolitres
this may sound very pragmatic but this message only aims to ease the material and spiritual suffering of north korean citizens

member of the commission madam president the green paper on pensions which we published last summer started a much needed debate on the future of pensions in europe
but i have little doubt that it has been heavily promoted by the large multinationals because it is they that stand to benefit most in my country in britain the vast majority of businesses are small and they provide for some seventy of employment

the results of the council of ministers of the twentysixth of june two thousand and three however have been insufficient in this regard
is this right or have i misunderstood
therefore the fact that europe pays but is incapable of using political pressure to ensure its objectives are put into practice shows that there is a need for a common foreign policy with common structures this applies not only to human rights but also to other problems and here if you do not mind i will turn to the situation in algeria as another example
the attitude taken by american pilots to cermis hardly bears description they were supposed to be carrying out military exercises but in fact slaughtered defenseless people

thank you for your kind words of appreciation
it is not my intention to deliver an indictment against the commission which is often unjustly and lets face it very conveniently made the scapegoat for distortions within the community for which others must also bear some of the responsibility

nor is this a onesizefitsall directive there is scope here for various national choices
thirdly people are generally willing to discount their future and sacrifice current living standards

do we really have to revert to cold sentiments unlike the united states which is offering openings

rising to this challenge is a joint necessity for all fifteen member states
i would like to ask the commissioner to insist that in future some kind of cooperation agreement is set up with the government of north korea
you are perhaps not aware of this but extensive animal tests are needed for example in order to be able to verify this sort of claim
in contrast to the protective measures applied to date which mainly related to selective fishing it is now proposed to protect the hitherto unwanted elements of the catch
if the commission itself acknowledges in its introductory statement that the cap reform of nineteen ninety two has not worked to the advantage of less favored regions and producers in respect of arable crops the most significant item of expenditure representing the bulk of direct income support we cannot remain hidebound by the logic of nineteen ninety two

madam president it is quite some time ago that i was rapporteur on the general directive the parent directive if you like on distance selling to consumers financial services were a subject for distance marketing then as well
i understand that the rationale behind this suggestion was not to achieve such an outcome but believe that this would actually restrict patients rights as defined by the court such administrative mechanisms run the risk of being both cumbersome and arbitrary
please do so
in some two years time the next elections to the european parliament will be taking place and the electorate is entitled to know what instruments and means of action the eu will have at its disposal consequently we should like to see the declaration include a common commitment to working on the necessary preconditions for this
these two latter taxes were amalgamated in the nineteen ninety one regulation so once again i agree with the analysis which was shared by mr s√°nchez garc√≠a
in particular i support the decision to direct a large portion of the e u r nine hundred and eighty million available to the eu for the period twenty million seventy two thousand and thirteen to the creation of new jobs as well as financing the construction in south africa of the necessary infrastructure to provide basic services in terms of health and security
it has been said that europe is sick well the first injection to cure it is an injection of confidence and confidence comes from the transparency and credibility of our institutions

this benefits both the public sector and domestic consumers and we are here to work for the good of our citizens
this has also been stressed by mr f√§rm who said that we need time to adapt our policy
eu regulations must also make it unambiguously clear that exports to other countries must always respect the strictly rules which these countries are entitled to introduce and this in full accordance with the cartagena protocol
what kind of madness is this where is the sense in such a contradiction

yet those who have this impression overlook or gloss over the fact that this is by no means a normal appointment procedure rather it is a matter of filling a key post that has farreaching powers and the right to conduct administrative investigations into every organization and institution of the union
people are running from lithuania while employers are seeking immigrants from third countries
it is always a great pleasure to receive a question from the honorable member whether it is in this chamber or in another place

we have to develop a territorial approach that suits the specific social conditions of the regions where most roma live and we have to do more to create employment for unskilled or low skilled people

violence affects women at various times of life from childhood to adulthood
this to me indicates a panic reaction and we must not allow our understandable concern with public health and it is proper that we should be concerned to unnecessarily undermine the importance of the common agricultural policy as an essential management support measure for sustainable european agriculture and in particular its importance in keeping the maximum number of farm families on the land of europe and as well in the broader context of rural development to which i know our present commissioner fischler is totally committed

this proposal seems to be a very complicated and not very efficient procedure to me
i am very concerned and unhappy about this answer from the council
nor would i say is it divided in the united states where as we know twothirds of the people oppose this war
the syrian people will not bow to tanks
confidence is also essential because the continuing development of the european model amongst other things depends on what scope for arrangements national and regional administrations will have in the future

moreover right from the beginning of its mandate this commission has fought for renewed vigor to be injected into the institutional debate in the union

firstly the gypsy minority should be integrated in the short term rather than the medium term there are still no clear measures and we can and should demand them immediately

madam president i too would like to thank the rapporteur who has had a tremendous job of work to do
we must however point out some features of the report that are negative and even contradictory one example is the argument for liberalizing trade in line with the patterns that the european union has been following particularly through the economic partnership agreements which the eu has been seeking to impose on african caribbean and pacific countries
in any case regardless of the position that this parliament adopts i ask the commissioner to agree with this proposal by giving a positive opinion to enable an assessment mechanism to be created which after a certain period will enable us to understand what the best proposal is in the light of the facts
the debate has reflected this need to ensure that we bridge the different views and find a workable solution in the end

in my view voting for this report means above all endorsing the ambitious approach set out by the tampere european council namely not just the statement that in the longer term community rules should lead to a common asylum procedure and a uniform status for those granted asylum valid throughout the union but also the commitment of that same tampere european council to the full and inclusive interpretation of the geneva convention
substances must not of course be included in such a list on a mere whim
rapporteur f r mr president i would like to say briefly that i hope that we are on the point of adopting by a large majority this european instrument for promoting democracy and human rights because it is the only instrument enabling us to support projects for promoting democracy in third countries without the support of the governments and it is therefore the only instrument that can provide a response to the issues that have just been raised by mr milinkievitch
there is no conflict between the internal market and social security since nothing is as crucial for social security as a job and an income

extremism is on the rise on both left and right as the established parties merge with one another and accordingly lack the credibility and the political vision that is acceptable to families in the member states

moreover the von wogau report which the european parliament has just voted on supports it in so doing

unfortunately the seats at euronest will remain empty while there is no freely and correctly elected parliament in the country

the charter of human rights states that whenever there is a conflict with animal rights human rights take precedence in other words the right to religious practices and not only muslim not only jewish but also christian practices as we have discussed at length in the committee should be protected and protected to the full not least because since we have reciprocal relations with nonmember countries people who practice certain types of religions could otherwise not eat meat in europe because it cannot be produced in europe and cannot be imported

a strengthened union must at least make it possible for new countries to join at the end of their journey they should find a house and not a shack awaiting them
however stagnation in the process of democratization was not all that happened last year so it is necessary to be critical where progress was not made or where the situation became worse but also to show that we value the changes for the better for on the one hand the need to strengthen the principles of the rule of law is being neglected and the constitution is based on this law so this should be made a priority

we in the west need to respect their values and cultures while providing financial assistance
however despite this undeniable step towards improving the status of european parties their main sources of funding are still individual membership subscriptions and to a small extent donations i would like to express the hope that the document which has been adopted will lead to a significant improvement in the position of political parties at european level
we support the fair assumptions on which the rapporteur at least wishes financing to be determined but we disagree with the choice of article forty three of the treaty as the decisionmaking procedure to be followed
and will he use the office of the presidency to promote support in third countries outside of the eu

the purpose of research and innovation is to bring products to market and improve our competitiveness this can only be achieved if there are significant levels of participation if the allocation instruments are transparent and if everyone from finland to sicily and greece knows what his or her position is
i believe that one tremendous thing we have been able to achieve together has been with regard to labeling in that public utilities will in future be under an obligation to indicate the source of the electricity which will in future be independently monitored by the commission with the establishment of a group of european regulatory authorities which will share their experience with one another and thereby promote competition to the benefit of consumers and of europes citizens

in the two thousand and five budget parliament boosted this voluntary pension fund by e u r one hundred and fourteen million that too is a large sum of money and it strikes me as normal for the list of end beneficiaries to be made public

that is why i voted in favour of the measures relating to the protection of these rights
p l mr president the regulation on the protection of animals during transport is extremely important and this kind of information is vital

with its publication we can at last at this point better highlight and give priority to the issue of the single market which for unavoidable reasons and which are difficult for the public to understand has not in my opinion received enough attention within the twenty twenty programmed
it is therefore only right that the european union should draw up community rules on how these nine million vehicles every year are to be recalled and processed
however during negotiations it is not possible to provide continual access to documents since the very nature of negotiations is that things get changed and then changed again
these goals as has already been mentioned must be measurable and must be binding whether it is a bonusmalus system or something else matters little but we need results

we are talking about poor execution and poor management
mr president i would like to congratulate the rapporteur mr andersson very warmly on his report on modernizing social protection which is now under discussion

the abolition of checks at internal borders ‚Äì that is the expansion of the schengen area ‚Äì is an important political objective for creating an area in the european union based on freedom

this report is meant to contribute to doing so
i also understand that there are member states such as yours which is why i have just been listening to you which have not fulfilled their duties and with this in mind i voluntarily proposed a date which has moreover been accepted by the committee on agriculture extending that timelimit slightly but as you know whereas they might pay two pounds an animal in your constituency in mine they only pay one pound

what initiatives does the commission intend to take
we must make sure that our words are followed by deeds

i could just as easily have been born on the other side of the iron curtain in which case i should have enjoyed far fewer opportunities than have been granted me in my life

it means as i said in my presentation ensuring that citizens are fully informed about practical information about their rights about the outcome of decisions about the way in which these are taken and about the legal basis

in this regard the control of the external borders of the states party to the schengen agreement is essential to achieving these objectives
what are the challenges that lie ahead
the proposal will take account of the studies undertaken and in particular look at such issues as universal service to which i will come back in a second

it is clear that there are a number of gaps remaining and that the insure and the claimant still face certain difficulties which need to be addressed
this ladies and gentlemen is added value
todays debate is without doubt just one chapter one stage of this process
we should however jointly evaluate our special national programmes
we have not finished the study we have hardly started it your contributions will therefore be very useful to us
the effectiveness of the measures which will be decreed depends on us being consistent but we must bear in mind that however coercive they are these measures cannot be totally impermeable
the union which is today in a position to do so should draw up and implement legislation to this end
we cannot do that alone as an institution nor can the european union do it alone to do so we need those who have to provide the resources to enable the people actually to be able to communicate in their own language on the data highway
the eu should not however conduct a common policy on tourism as proposed in the report
the events of recent days in istanbul demonstrate the importance of cooperation with turkey especially on security issues

i am following the committees line and would therefore ask colleagues not to support these amendments amendments nos thirty one to thirty four

i would like to request two things mr president
the information which the commission compiled via the information network of agricultural accounts and structural surveys should in fact suffice in order to analyse the situation of young farmers and i do not think that we need nor does it make sense to set up a new database especially for young farmers
if these are described then we can also conclude that there are areas where we also need an external energy representative

he will be summoned before the court and if he does not obey this summons he will be arrested if he ever enters the territory of the federal republic of germany again
internet security means not only the use of smart cards and virus protection but also protection from harmful and illegal content
so like the rapporteur and like many others here i consider it essential internationally that social clauses are instituted not just to safeguard the european economy but also to help developing countries to rise up out of their difficult conditions
we should not forget the centres of research excellence particularly in the united states and we should seek as wide a collaboration as we can insofar as the eu can assist in that through the research programmes et we certainly should
i agree with the previous speakers in this respect in particular my colleague
following the beirut damascus declaration which was signed in may of two thousand and six and which appealed for improved relations between lebanon and syria the syrian security forces arrested a dozen or so people for expressing views in this declaration that were different to the those of the syrian government
the commissions estimates showed that a twenty increase in e e could potentially create as many as a million new jobs in europe and an average household can save at least e u r one zero per year
it is primarily a question of removing the differences between the internal market and social policy and creating a single economic and social union
the eu s credibility will be in the balance and in my opinion this is a bad start for the further development of the eu s foreign and security policy
this clearly also means as mr leinen has already mentioned that we urgently need more modules in this regard we can look back to the nineteen seventies and nineteen eighties when all of this had already been worked out
as we have always stressed in connection with chechnya however it is also important to fight the causes of terrorism and in many cases these are poverty and poor economic development
that is indeed the case and it is not open to question
finally i should like to draw the attention of the european parliament and the commission to the habitual delays in consulting the european parliament something which is now part of our history
just as the resolution says i believe that now is the time for the eu to really show the way and to dare to move forwards to leave the reluctant and sluggish united states behind it and together with others to try to ratify the kyoto agreement
in fact we are patting ourselves on the back because the bond auctions in portugal went well last week whereas the reality is that the european central bank was actually using taxpayers money to buy their own debt

in establishing european works councils the solutions more or less made to measure and reached at company level between the management and the special employee negotiating body are granted priority
we said yes to customs union
as greece has not yet provided the necessary justification to demonstrate that such excesses of p m one zero are due to natural events the commission expects to receive plans and programmes in accordance with article eight of the framework directive by the end of two thousand and three these should show how greece intends to achieve the limit values by two thousand and five
of course as i said before we want to further consolidate the energy relationship on the basis of the most important principles which are reciprocity fairness and equality
it regarded the calculations submitted by switzerland as by and large plausible
we shall certainly take action in this regard

the proposal is for a five retention in my opinion ten is far more appropriate and that is why i have tabled an amendment

he described saudi arabia as a country with enormous potential and vast financial resources

i welcome the efforts by the african union to assemble a peacekeeping force to help with national reconciliation but only twenty of the promised eight zero have actually been deployed

therefore it is fundamental that they are developed and decided upon in a fully transparent manner which effectively enables the parliament and the council to democratically control the exercise of the power delegated to the commission

mr president justice requires reason and prudence

we must provide women with the means and resources required to escape a reality which year after year kills hundreds of women from all countries of the union

as the european parliament in the past we have made the proposal that a special representative be appointed to deal with the issue of tibet but we know that the proposal has so far not been implemented
whether or not globalisation takes place is not determined in brussels or strasbourg
the last point i want to raise is that we really ought to have a basic debate on this whole question of taxes one day
in other words even if mr ≈°emeta is currently working on the impact assessment there is no point in investigating whether or not a transaction tax can work we should investigate only in which submarkets it can be introduced nationally in which submarkets it can be introduced across europe and those submarkets where it can only be introduced globally
these concerns are however drowned out in a hotchpotch of irresolute declarations
the commission is fully in the picture as regards the delays in greece and its services are closely monitoring and evaluating the progress that is being made
it is a political responsibility to secure access to vocational training and further training and to make it equally available to everyone

the benefit derived from europol stands in direct proportion to the number of crimes solved in which context it can be said that the support provided by europol has taken the work forward

with continued enlargement on the one hand we are taking up an historical challenge that we do not of course want to miss but on the other we must also do what we can so that the identity of our cultures and our peoples is not lost
mr president i am sorry but i cannot say that i agree with this document as it stands or with the contents of the green paper
although some question the importance of open consultation i believe that all stakeholders should have an opportunity to express their opinion
from this point of view we accept the commission proposal in that and this should be made very clear here the genuine political debate will come about when we see what the council makes of the commissions preliminary draft budget
i am not very much in favour of a system of quotas in this field for this risks introducing an element of rigidity in an intervention system based on subsidiary and the initiative of local and regional authorities
so i totally endorse the honorable members reference to the importance of infrastructure investment but i think encouraging more sensible trading relationships between those countries is also absolutely crucial
as far as thursday is concerned
that is great
it is about free movement for people and freedom to live their lives as they wish a free market for people a common market for eu citizens and their families
however the rapporteurs proposals take several steps backwards
we believe that this is an important complement to the lehne report on the european private company statute
this explains why three quarters of the people suffering from hunger in developing countries are small farmers
vocational education and training are an area which has acquired particular importance in recent years
the eu m d g agenda should set a global example and we should be pushing for this example to be followed by the rest of the international community at the un general assembly in september

he was a young twenty five yearly man who joined the new police service and was killed because of it it is not just an attack on this young man and his family but on the peace process in my constituency as well
how does the council view the treatment that these persons are receiving in u s jails
yet the picture is mixed elephant numbers are recovering in some areas but this causes the destruction of the natural habitat
the commission is aware of the weak points
relations between europe and central america so close in a time of war have become distant in a time of peace
a positive approach will benefit f y r o m which we hope will be helped to join both ŒΩŒ±œÑŒø and the eu if f y r o m refuses to accept the name chosen for it and persists in this refusal it will find that there are obstacles to its accession because it has undermined its own efforts
whatever the outcome i believe that we will be returning again to this issue in the future
i should like to use this opportunity to state my position concerning future enlargements
i therefore support the commission proposal which could be integrated into a european agricultural model
from this perspective i find the numerous references in this text to the features of a state such as country government citizens borders and so on unacceptable
i would like you to give me a specific answer to this question because at the time of the treaty of nice the commission put forward good proposals and good positions which were then ignored by the council
madam president ladies and gentlemen when representatives of the communist serbia of milosevic were here as a delegation seven years ago at the time of the heroic liberating rebellion of slovenia and croatia i had made the following three observations
mr president the commission is doing its utmost to settle proper payment applications within sixty days
nonetheless we disagree with it in essence this agreement is particularly inadequate from the point of view of financial resources
secondly i think that on the european parliament website under the personal profiles retailing the activities of each m e p it would be a good idea to also publish the amendments submitted by each m e p in the parliamentary committees they belong to
at the same time prevention is different to military and civil crisis management in that it is not about reacting to a crisis that has already flared up but about promoting in good time the fundamental values on which we all agree that children should be able to go to school instead of to war and that democracy must be established at all levels
it is not about changing the vat regime i wish the commission could do that
both sides need to play by the rules
it is becoming so easy to make a good living out of crime at the taxpayers expense that when we talk about the level playing field in so many areas of activity involving public subsidies you could say that the level playing field is now crooked
it is a sign of progress that everyone here today acknowledges this it is absolutely imperative however that future regional planning policies incorporate this new information on environmental considerations and sustainable development particularly within the framework of the structural funds and the common agricultural policy
we have to address this issue
the european union has always considered humanitarian policy and the protection of fundamental human rights to be its priorities its vocation which today allows it to play a leading role on the world stage and export beyond its borders the principles of democracy respect for human rights and legality enables us to understand the reasons behind the proposal for a joint resolution aimed at calling on belarus to respect all the efforts that have been made on matters of international law and human rights
these are in large measure the consequences of that policy which is based on persuading agriculture to produce less
anyway i am going to make a point that has an international implication taking my cue from what happened at the recent n a t o summit in madrid during which it was decided to extend that military organization to bring in poland hungary and the czech republic to demonstrate that europe is still lacking a common european security policy
the second point is that in my opinion we need rules based on sustainable development
the amsterdam treaty is to enter into force and will intensify the pressure for reform not just the pressure to enhance the eus ability to act the european elections will be taking place in june
that means that we need instruments to exercise the necessary controls
to be honest i find it astonishing that we now find ourselves having to take an almost defensive line of argument because we cannot consider this issue on the basis of the euratom regulations alone but that we also have to consider consumer protection protection for the population in the event of major accidents in nuclear power plants based on the rules of the european treaty so that we have complete control and a say in the final outcome
the new e i b corporate governance statement provides a useful summary of its policies across a range of corporate governance aspects
i am therefore grateful to the commission for making it crystalclear that the nordea problem which is essentially about the reimbursement of contributions must be resolved by the member states
resistance is growing both on the streets and in the negotiating chambers new players are appearing and claiming a place in the game
this does not however mean that i am not a firm defender of womens rights
there is still some work to be done in the common space of freedom security and justice

resolving the situation as quickly as possible however makes us dependent for our energy supplies on unstable countries with doubtful democratic credentials security of energy supply is an important element of general security

i taught law for many years at various universities and this report by the committee for which was rapporteur would not be given particularly high marks by the faculty of law at the university of copenhagen
is it the case that the particular difficulty in getting agreement on the package relates to a very specific part of the package and if so why is it felt necessary to delay the entire package of reform
that is why i proposed challenging member states to remove the barriers imposed on the citizens of other member states and opening up their domestic labour markets
proposals to this end have been made in the context of the quality package including reducing the time for the commission to scrutinized applications received to six months and reducing the objection period to two months
however such a budget will create unfair competition to european union wines and beers this goes against w t o principles
in this context i must criticism the decision motivated largely by political considerations to decommission prematurely the nuclear power plant at jaslovsk√© bohunice although the plant meets operational safety requirements

it would be difficult in the long term to impose a lot of major new tasks upon the commission without also providing the necessary resources in terms of staff and administrative resources

mr president ladies and gentlemen i too must congratulate mr wiersma on his excellent report
the idea is of course to transmit the electricity to europe via high voltage direct current lines from the deserts
this sort of attitude this kind of thinking seems to be insinuating itself into sport and if the european parliament fails to react to it we will actually be failing in our fundamental duty to create a better and fairer society
i wish to make one comment on the studies
for example the community fleet under the spanish flag only has access to eight species out of the twenty two for which there are quotas
the integrated security in europe conference which was held in november gave rise to a debate on strictly control of the sector
for instance if parliaments budget estimates for the year two thousand provide for a sum of e u r thirty eight million just for setting up a supermarket that means that here too as i and the committee on budgets are suggesting we must carry out our control function
i am convinced that regional cooperation should in addition to turkey and russia include the eu member states as equal partners too that is why i have voted in favour of the report
i did it myself as a kid actually
if we come along and steal this away and turn it into political legislation we completely remove this competitive parameter and that if i may say so is sheer political stupidity
mr president commissioner fischler ladies and gentlemen yesterday we dealt with an urgent motion in relation to energy policy here and we tackled safety issues in the area of nuclear power
while exercising the caution that is always needed in such cases i believe that this is very good news and i am sure that the house will share our satisfaction which makes up for our disgust on other occasions when we have had to speak about the crimes of this organization
the eu has always been mindful of the events of recent months it must make a genuine commitment to proper negotiations with syria with a view to securing the countrys firm desire to conclude the agreement
the task now is to sit down together and clarify what is still possible within the existing treaty provisions
this is the view of academics and industrialists
i heartily agree with what she says
as i said the rapporteur has presented a very good proposal and for that i thank him
we are prepared to allow flexibility in such circumstances
once again we need those on the ground to tell us what actually happened
before finishing we must stress that president cavaco silva of portugal recently stated in germany that there was new hope with regard to qimonda
in writing p t according to the report obtaining commercial advantages by establishing free trade agreements f t a s with various regions is the best political strategy for europe to overcome the crisis at least while the impasse in the world trade organisation continues
who has not been concerned at the plans of certain private groups to create their own sports competitions outside the jurisdiction of the national and international federations and on the basis of a single criterion namely the size of the participating clubs budgets as we have recently seen in association football and subsequently in basketball too
this was a heavy blow not only against the coptic christians themselves but also against the tolerance which is still widespread in egypt
these initiatives should be undertaken in accordance with the lisbon agenda which seeks to boost potential economic performance by increasing the flexibility of the markets in goods capital and labour
there is nothing that can be done about this for that is how it is in this house
who knows about small and mediumsized companies and another thing why are i f r s for small and mediumsized companies actually on the agenda right now

the commission plans to implement one of these initial programmes in belarus a country responsible for numerous human rights violations which maintains no diplomatic relationship with the union and which offers no guarantee regarding the protection of migrants
to our very deep regret that was not the case
that is why i hope the house will support mrs gebhardt s report
steps also have to be taken to improve fuel efficiency in the sector
it is important to preserve the rights of member state parliaments and governments to ensure that existing legislation in these areas can be maintained
we must therefore once again call for the abolition of the death penalty as the european union has been doing for a long time
if then we are to talk in terms of more competition we need not only european agencies but also a quality mark for some kind of quality mark has the natural effect of building confidence and enhancing the value in the market
at the moment i see two basic problems associated with this process
the rapporteur intends through his amendments to the commissions proposal to achieve a more complete harmonization of the legislation pertaining to monetary policy
the commissions concrete targets have been criticized because they are hard to measure
we are well on the way to doing so but we must continue to work at it
mad cow disease was in the headlines about five years ago one wonders whether more could have been achieved in the area of research at that time
i am confident that you will continue to support the just cause of the palestinian people until we gain our freedom and build an independent state in the holy land on the basis of the nineteen sixty seven borders with the state of israel
not because it is not a good idea to ensure that all member states have good laws against incitement but because it is difficult if not impossible to arrive at a definition which could be applied uniformly and which would not lead to thorny problems of interpretation on the one hand there is the important task of devising ways of combating terrorism and saving lives
secondly i feel that following the various reports that the commission could present to us it could be useful for parliament to draw up an owninitiative report on the development of metalworking in the face of what will undoubtedly be at stake in the enlargement process
aung san suu who was elected leader in burmas elections remains under arrest
what is happening in madagascar is something much more serious which warrants much more than fleeting attention

i should therefore like the french translation service to get into the habit of referring to stoa studies and not reports so that european parliament committees can hold on to their independence and powers
i support the ending of inheritance and gift taxes in particular when a business is handed on within the family
we really do need to combine such supervision and ensure that these securities are anticipated on both sides and that such occurrences are prevented
mr president i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur mrs weiler on her report her worthy aims and her valuable proposals
it is also vital that opposition parties participate fairly in these elections
if we in the european parliament can agree that member states have the right under the principle of subsidiary to regulate their gambling markets according to their own traditions and cultures we also then have to ensure that this is actually happening through efficient control and market surveillance

i have no criticism to make of the hard work
it is trying to compensate for the called failure of the market through taxation introducing ego taxes and supporting science and research by means of tax writeoffs which will make the tax system less transparent and require new european legislation

indeed the fact that the directive was due for amendment which incidentally has still not occurred and this is now two thousand and eight is in no way relevant to the complaint

it is for example very positive that we now have colleges of supervisors handling big multijurisdiction pan european cases but sometimes these colleges lack authority they do not have enough resources they do not take enough majority decisions for example so it would be very good if we could consider more qualified majority voting in level three committees as well as in the colleges of supervisors

we need to better coordinate the provision of aid abandon the redundant formalities and strengthen control in order to be able to respond to the everchanging situation
i shall conclude by making two points
i shall cite three examples
this places us in a position where we can have dialogue with these countries tackling the question of a euro mediterranean citizenship where human rights issues are not a question of us interfering in their affairs but of the common need to establish values which are at the basis of the kind of peaceful coexistence we want
however in my view the most important question is missing
in the same letter the belgian authorities informed me that mrs ries had been replaced by mrs jacqueline rousseaux with effect from the nineteenth of february two thousand and four
we must analyse whether the money that was spent yielded the benefit we were expecting and whether we achieved the objective we set ourselves
i have previously asked about the alleged involvement of the european own intelligence resources in the management of slush funds in offshore accounts and i still await a reply
what i learned from this conference was that it is possible to reach the same objective without resorting to inflammatory language and for that reason the group of the european peoples party christian democrats and european democrats has not used the term agricultural reform outing instead for an expression that although rather more unwieldy has found its way into the joint resolution simply in order to avoid provoking counterreactions that would then get us no nearer our objective
that is why i proposed random checking and fingerprinting at border crossings
from the e c o n committees perspective there are three issues which i would like to raise
it is clear from this that we cannot accept a large number of the amendments
it is all too obvious that monsanto is trying to infiltrate more into europe
sucralose presents no problems it is made from sugar it is noncalorific it does not lead to tooth decay or and here let me declare an interest to risks for those of us who live with diabetes
up to ninety eight of our nonfarm businesses employ under fifty employees some ninety of small businesses employ fewer than ten
action against burma is well overdue
womens experience and skill remain insufficiently used in environmental policy actions
this will ensure that the stability of the markets will not be threatened
in the same way the commissioners private offices must have a supranational structure as i have maintained for years
this objection concerns in particular amendments nos one five six seven eight nine and thirteen also a considerable period of time would be required to set up appropriate new administrative and indeed monitoring mechanisms in time to be effective and this would create difficulties that would make it impossible to ensure that the resources were shared out in good time
if we were to link together projects across the different departments we would be able to achieve much more for the rural areas such as decentralised energy infrastructures broadband cabling over a much larger area and crossborder water infrastructures
we must appear united if we want to pursue common goals and he was right to point this out
but we shall have a decision very soon
here we now have aggressive action on the part of the israeli government we have barbarous foolish and dangerous acts and from that standpoint i think those acts should be condemned by the european union the united states and by every international agency
we do not have them under control because our approach is a strongly centralist one
as well as being the result of communal efforts these proposals are also based upon a thorough impact assessment which has confirmed the technical and financial feasibility of the proposals
mr president commissioner you will surely not be surprised to hear that i am not happy with the answer you have given us especially as we made great efforts several weeks ago to make contact with a very wide range of representatives of the commission in particular commissioner verheugen and demanded clear answers
time is short but recent developments both on the island and in ankara have created a window of opportunity and i hope that you mr presidentin office will work with all parties to craft a compromise
additionally as a simultaneous byproduct and without incurring additional costs we can obtain highly accurate geometrical databases that can be used to monitor and manage the artefact in the event of natural disasters as well as products for scientific education and for promoting the artefact on a global scale fulfilling criteria for cultural understanding and exchange
first the authorities have to make further progress on the legislation associated with the sixteen points
any dissonant noises are treachery and have to be silenced
initially there was a complete ban now closing is allowed on a therapeutic basis but not for reproductive purposes
the problem is that we have to contend with multinational companies as you said europe has to take the lead in corporate social responsibility but it also has to take the lead as regards the conduct of european companies located outside europe
surely that is too crazy for words but it is only the tip of the iceberg
governments already use the most sophisticated means to monitor national and international communications
decades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry for we all know how long it takes a tree to grow
it is absolutely true that one of the initial flashpoints of this balkan crisis was kosovo the repression of kosovo and the abolition of vojvodinas autonomy originated the crisis in former yugoslavia
i do not think it is appropriate to use that word
i would very much like to see europe take part in a constructive approach not just for us as europeans but also for the rest of the world
the directive aims to enable layers who practice under the title given by their countryoforigin to establish branches and subsidiaries
these numbers are practically the same as the nineteen ninety six budget
nevertheless we are very concerned about the situation in kosovo everything is going in the wrong direction there at present
then there is the continuity of the service its quality and the specific results the transparency of its administration and its receptiveness to consultation with users
mr president i would like to return to a matter which i am recorded as having raised in yesterdays minutes
however as previous speakers have said the declaration does not contain any convincing references to the social state what some people somewhat sheepishly call the social model sustainable development viable development autonomy and hence if i may put it thus a viable union profile
how did we restructured
the report expresses the eu philosophy of producing foodstuffs in order to increase the profits of the food industry not to meet the peoples food requirements
what we want is to make it clear that the status quo is no longer an option today that europe has serious competitiveness problems when compared to other regions of the world and that we intend to put this right by adapting and renewing our social model
they are vulnerable to threats which no longer respect national borders as a result of their interconnection with and interdependency on other infrastructures and the inability to guarantee their security and resilience based on purely national approaches
once more world food security has been in the spotlight however the time for discussion is over now it is time to deliver
when i protested and demanded the release of some c w i colleagues the police themselves told me that it was preventive arrest preventive detention
you even have three minutes time enough to score an equalize i think
incidentally this is banned in america
having said that certain amendments approved by the committee on civil liberties and internal affairs seem to be characterized by views which are somewhat unrealistic even demagogic which far from promoting the situation of thirdcountry nationals would risk causing rejection by the people of the host nations
the oligarchs in both countries have been involved in this and what is the role of these presidents in generating huge sums of hidden profit
it broadly agrees both with the commissions analysis of the situation and with its conclusions
no we cannot do this
the final decision to grant or refuse development consent must take into consideration the results of consultations and the information gathered and must contain the main reasons on which it is based
so do not send your waste to dounreay under any belief that it is going to be safely disposed of
however the management of the programmed and cooperation with the iraqi government in implementing it is not effective
there used to be an american play called same time next year
giving substance to the new approach means giving the ors the means to become genuine partners for europe and that is where we need a fresh perspective to envisage a today partnership from which everyone will benefit
that would be completely counterproductive
de mr president mrs boumediene thiery s report addresses the problems that the commission mentions in its report on how matters stand with regard to the application of provisions on residence rights
there is however one area where we do have considerable scope for improving the lives of senior citizens in very practical ways and i am thinking here of how we can use the machinery of european cooperation to ensure mutual recognition of acquired social rights such as sickness pay and pensions
however the dumping that goes on today between our various countries helps destabilise markets and i believe that europe should tackle this issue
this is obviously very important
we should therefore start to consider seriously the demand for every industrial or mining activity to be licensed only when the resulting waste will be immediately and completely destroyed or neutralized as part of the manufacturing or production cycle
does it require detailed voluminous risk assessments before work is carried out a height no it does not it is a very easily understood readable implementable directive and it should be described in that way
i would like to wish the presidency every success in its work on implementing one europe
without them financing and other mechanisms are of no use
madam president i think it is pretty rich to compare the european arrest warrant with a party statute however there are of course parties particularly in germany where there is a close link between arrest warrants and their party statute
i would like to pose a more philosophical question if the law were to be widened in such a way that it enabled the bugging of both ministers and presidents as happened in lithuania and if this somehow endured a greater war on corruption crime and the abuse of power would you still believe that such a path is risky and that we need to think more about citizens rights
it would be a pity if the p p e d e stood by its initial choices which instead of resulting in the exploitation of the competitiveness of quality which is the advantage of the european economy insist on more and more exploitation of cheap labour
i believe the greatest contribution we can and must make is to stand by our convictions and be prepared to take on the costs and the responsibility
it did so in relation to directive two hundred thousand one hundred and forty four e c dealing with mutual assistance on the recovery of tax claims
in the interests of making this process easier the commission has accordingly pushed ahead with a programmed for training thirdcountry crew members and for recognition on the part of member states of qualifications issued by third countries
this includes a package of measures aimed at intensifying and structuring the contexts with dissidents and civil society as well as with the cuban authorities
in my view our main priority at present is not ratification of the lisbon treaty
the heads of government have the choice they can either recognize the rights of parliament and its projects or they can humiliate parliament in which case there will be no budget

i am not talking about negotiations with russia on belarus as this would only imply that russia has some sort of special rights to this country
i took very careful note of commissioner fischler s remarks perhaps the most practical suggestions we have heard to date
at modane the destination of the first people leaving via the fr√©jus pass of the eighty two kurds welcomed with such ceremony forty have vanished into thin air
despite the simplifications we must guard against the risks of spoiling them or reducing their effectiveness in this context what is surprising in the commission proposal is the lack of detail in the scope of the measure and the fact that the commission is relying on the accounting network to evaluate it
then we will have to make cuts in places which is perhaps not the right way to do it
it is going increasingly mobile and recent threat analysis suggests that organised crime is getting increasingly involved in criminal activities in cyberspace
i am impressed with the way in which the p p e seems to have moved from its rather negative position in the environment committee debate into accepting some of the principal amendments which we think are important
we should ask ourselves a very straightforward question namely whether afghanistan would not export terrorism to the rest of the world to an even greater extent than it does now if we did not provide it with financial aid
right from the start the our was a completely misjudged construct that was bound to fail it is not possible to shoehorn together states with completely different national economies under a single shared currency
i believe that in a country as oilrich as nigeria equal access to resources and income redistribution are necessary for the peaceful resolution of these conflicts
mr duff as regards the need to ratify the treaty as you understand i fully share that priority and i think precisely that the social and cultural dimension of europe should be highlights i am doing my best in this matter trying to explain that in europe we need a strong internal market but europe is more than a market and i think you can agree that this is also a shared commitment
i believe that at the very least european consumers must be able to recognize in future whether the products they are buying come from a particular country where basic principles do not apply
and if due attention is being paid to the risks of transporting these substances by road another terrestrial mode of transport the same should be done with maritime transport

latvia has satisfied the conditions for membership of the european union i am not the one who should be applauded today for this success
in other words risks caused by the selfemployed worker which they are not protected from
the adoption of a code of good administrative behaviour for the european institutions would also provide a guarantee for the public who would be able to consult it freely
enormous damage has been done through reckless behaviour and the cost of sorting out the mess must be borne by those involved
i had hoped we would go much further in implementing a procedure of economic arbitration with regard to european regulators but of course we could not achieve everything at once
we are tied to the funds available
secondly the commission has introduced immigration as an urgent issue
i should very quickly like to make the following comments
the fusion reactor iter could also play a role in this respect for it is in research into fusion and plasma that nanotechnology presents a whole new challenge as a means of advancing energy efficiency minimizing losses due to wear and tear and of developing strategies for fighting against corrosion not least in the generation of energy
but unfortunately it took quite considerable time for anything to be done on that
unfortunately it is not only germany
my gratitude to them is no less heartfelt
mr barroso your political guidelines provide little illumination as to your plans and drag out much of the same rhetoric used five years ago
assessing the exceptional character of any disaster is left to the discretion of the commission which hitherto has only regarded it as applying to damage caused by hurricanes
human rights are it is true the most appropriate basis for the worship of a particularly obnoxious vice called hypocrisy unfortunately the report we are debating here today has a grave historical tradition behind it since as long ago as one thousand seven hundred and ninety three robespierre had a particularly demagogic declaration on human rights approved by the convention and accompanied it with a brand of state terrorism known as the terror
we will also be organizing a conference on commerce in rural areas during the first few months of nineteen ninety eight and this conference will take place with the cooperation of the committee on regional policy

after this consultation the committees concluded that there were no grounds for believing that the gene for ampicillin resistance in maize could be detrimental to the health of humans or animals

because the question has been asked i shall also just touch on the fact that the fixed subsidy rates do not favour the export of live animals
in fact article forty nine of the treaty on european union does not apply in this case it provides for the accession procedure for european states it does not cover other countries

knowledge is certainly another factor i would like to mention another figure here
and finally commissioner protection against cover attacks and terrorist attacks has to be established in all sectoral policies of the european union where crossborder emission of hazardous materials may occur

finally a few closing words on our draft
a better understanding of the picture will certainly help

i am less impressed by some of the points in the commission s proposal for example concerning the distribution of costs between the eu and the member states at present seventy per cent for the eu and thirty per cent for the member states
what i do not see is any concern expressed for those in financial services or for the customers they serve

mr president yesterday i gave an explanation of vote in writing on trafficking in human beings and there is no record of it in the minutes
as you indicated berisha is exploiting the situation in kosovo to the hilt in order to destabilise the situation in albania too

i should like to advocate that a great deal of attention be paid to the interconnection of route plans at international level therefore

underutilisation on this scale seriously undermine the entire administrative process with regard to the eu budget
as you can see there is much for us to do in contending with the trafficking in human beings and we have to be aware that these tragedies are being played out on our doorsteps
for example a week ago the commission opened an antidumping investigation in connection with certain types of chinese and indian shoes
the regulation also sets up an information mechanism to keep all member states informed of actual or potential obstacles and action being taken against them
however the agreement arrived at with senegal obviously undermine to some extent the development objective of poverty alleviation because the agreement gives the eu fleet and others i presume access to demersal species and to pelagic species which are the principal source of protein not only for senegalese people but also for those peoples of africa who live in landlocked countries
may i once again sincerely thank the european parliament for its excellent levels of cooperation in the negotiations on the framework research programmed
i think that is all that need be said
no what we need most of all is more efficient spending

the mechanism of the market if left to itself would meet the needs of supply and demand at competitive prices
we swedish conservatives believe that through production and trade we can not only put an end to poverty but also improve our environment

in this context i would also like to say that the social activities carried out by churches and religious societies merit special praise
ro mr president i welcome the civil movements in tunisia and egypt that have successfully toppled two dictatorial regimes which had become entrenched over several decades
this is a worrying sign a sign that terror works that the mutilation and killing of citizens not only remains unpunished but even pays that any parlor could take up arms against a democratically elected government and be rewarded into the bargain for the government the peace agreement is a pragmatic solution

i would now like to address the british presidency with all due respect friendship and frankness
per capita g d p is not sufficient on its own
our request is made for reasons of legislative technique a somewhat mysterious term meaning that in our opinion postponing the vote for a few weeks could help our institution to negotiate an outcome that is positive or at least more positive than the situation that would arise if we were to vote on this draft tomorrow
earlier today mrs oomen ruijten delivered a report on this aspect
i would also add that when we talk of the possibility of introducing tests for example in the event of dispute between the commission and member states or in the event of dispute between the commission and third countries carrying out tests can also help to decide if a country belongs in risk category i i i or i i i if for example certain statistics cannot be organised differently
it has been a very comprehensive hearing procedure and the aim is to give a new impetus through community arrangements
the european union is showing through an initiative of this kind the importance it attaches to a new balanced world governance

thank you very much mr sturdy but your comments do not refer to the minutes
in conditions offering anonymity and without any controls the upshot of this is disclaimed responsibility when it comes to choosing and using linguistic terms these terms are often infiltrated by slang cynicism and even vulgarity
this is a commitment from the eu to avoid policy choices that undermine its salutary work in the field of development cooperation and indeed to pursue actions across the policy spectrum that will benefit developing countries
for once we can express our support for the initiative of the international community which through the ambassadors of nineteen countries in nairobi strongly condemned the tragic events and demanded that a process of democratic reforms be launched
p t given the rocking fuel prices and bearing in mind their devastating effects on people and business transport fisheries agriculture and industry it cannot be forgotten that the big oil companies have seen a massive increase in their profits basically as a result of the practice of price speculation which is based on the speculative valuation of cheaply acquired oil stocks

alongside the integration of women in the labour market the encouragement of women in timetested ways and gender mainstreaming as a framework policy we want an equal opportunities programmed

the citizens and the economy of the eu require rapid and specific decisions and action which will ensure relatively low and stable energy costs over the next fifteen years decisions which will lead to the most significant savings possible in industry transport and homes decisions which will in large measure reduce the dependence of the eu economy on the import of hydrocarbons and ensure their correct supply decisions which will lead as quickly as possible to the development of a programmed and plan of specific researchbased measures and how to finance and implement them
this is a good example of how we can do that effectively
renewable energy offers numerous advantages for europe lower c o two emissions reduced european dependency and a contribution to job creation and growth
mr korakas has the floor for a point of order
i am also a fighter for human rights

this was one of the messages that emerged from the world social forum in porto alegre europe must take heed of the ardent hopes of those who are exhorting us to play our part in the pursuit of that goal

this resolution testifies to the fact that believers in the i p c c s views have not understood anything the main weakness of cop fifteen was a failure to appreciate the sensitivity of third countries and developing countries and also some eu countries to climate justice the fact that the two greatest superpowers the u s a and china are competing with each other both economically and militarily and the fact that the ambitious plans to limit c o two emissions were based on the paradigm of anthropogenic climate warming which does not have a great deal of scientific credibility
it is now up to the commission to listen to the wisdom which we have shown in parliament and to come back with concrete proposals on how we are to give effect to children rights which now with the new lisbon treaty become an objective to be embodied in law in the eu

these fora would moreover provide a place where scientists fishermen and all of the other stakeholders including the regional authorities could do precisely what you call for in your motion namely hold regular consultations
the difference is that in december nineteen ninety five we could have thrashed things out around the table and now all we can do is make a protest on paper this will of course not stop me from approving the paper protest because it may after all still make a small contribution to letting turkey our neighbor country and n a t o partner know that the best possible neighbours can only remain so if first of all the turkish occupation troops leave cyprus and certainly if the turkish threat of war because that is what it is ceases
we know about the called line of control guarded by the armed forces of the two countries

i very much hope that the trend towards the decreasing importance of school sport can be turned round
there are formal legal issues with the legal basis but there are also substantive political issues i will mention a variety of subjects the agency for fundamental rights the data retention question ‚Äì in other words topics on which i have proposed that this parliament should work within a substantive political interinstitutional agreement whatever the formal legal bases
unless that happens i warn the council that whether it be the italian presidency winding up to their presidency in july or mr spring or mr bruton presenting the programmed of the irish presidency this parliament will roundly reject the conclusions of florence unless the council gives a real commitment to bringing unemployment down getting growth back to europe and ensuring that the emu project can continue on a path that will mean something to the citizens rather than simply being something which is pursued by central bankers
our position mr president ladies and gentlemen is that we should not begin a budgetary year in the certainty that the budgetary amounts earmarked for this budgetary line are insufficient to meet any obligations arising from international fishery agreements already signed by the community agreements which represent one of the fundamental bases of the common fisheries policy which explains our amendment which has already been detailed by the committee on fisheries and which should be adopted
would it increase or weaken europes military stability
the credit rating agencies are dependent on getting customers but they will have no customers if they say that their customers are not creditworthy
this report is completely unbalanced in favoring a prospect whereby the eu would in future enjoy a status at least equivalent to that of the member states in global and regional multilateral organizations
indeed outplacement and relief require a rapid firm approach which is totally lacking at the moment
here there is a telling inconsistency in european policy it supports the spread of democracy in the world but has chosen to impose eu sanctions against the palestinian government which came into being through demonstrably free and democratic elections

on behalf of the p s e group n l mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i would like to start by congratulations mrs jensen i am not doing this just as a matter of form but in all sincerity

furthermore the european union is founded on unassailable values which include combating all forms of discrimination and i will work to uphold this value throughout my term of office
the parliaments resolution is even worse than the commission proposals
you only have to listen to what the indefectible supporters of this tax have been telling us they say that it is a political problem that the technical solutions hardly matter
during the crisis on the international financial markets in the last six months europe proved a centre of stability and that success gives every reason for confidence confidence that it is possible to maintain the stability achieved with such great effort while at the same time setting out in new directions that it is possible to strengthen stability and growth and therefore employment too

the next issue is the question of the brain drain which is an important consideration
to my chagrin the dutch parliament in particular has been guilty of this type of behaviour even as recently as this week

is the commission aware of this situation and how will it take it into account when it assesses the czech application for protection of designation of origin

the only question i have about the giansily report is paragraph five which talks about important products without any cost to the european budget or disruption to european markets
i believe that in terms of applying cuts the efforts of the council are quite sufficient since it is a great specialist in that area
mr president first of all i would like to congratulate the rapporteur for her report
in its initial phase it was administered by a small foundation based in brussels with both the european parliament and the commission playing an active role in the allocation and supervision of projects
on behalf of the u e n group ga mr president the leaders of the european union signed the reform treaty on the european union last december this treaty will ensure that the european union will operate more effectively in the years to come

we will move on to the other rapporteurs and if he arrives in time we will give him the floor

on behalf of the european parliament i offer condolences and expressions of sympathy to the victims families

i totally agree with finding viable solutions for enhancing our citizens security

in this connection the proclamation of independence is quite a normal process besides it was made calmly serenely and unemotionally and with full respect for the ahtisaari plan in the countrys parliament
prime minister i welcome your speech today it offers the promise to our continental colleagues of a less perfidious albion
as the rapporteurs statement was not correct i think this constitutes a point of order
one of the problems is that it is very difficult to find concrete reliable data on the impact of untying
as both mr cunningham and mr perry have quite rightly said we must not underestimate the economic damage that will come from this decision
thus i am very glad that this text was agreed at first reading since urgent progress must be made in this field
i am afraid i can say no more at this moment but no doubt mrs riisj√∂rgensen the committee of which she is a member and myself will engage in dialogue as soon as a more concrete proposal has been formulated

the european union has been enforcing export control measures on dualism items for nearly fifteen years
with regard to our priorities these will remain in the first place the internal policies that are to support the lisbon objectives not forgetting the environment and rural development
the measures proposed include labour market policy measures information campaigns dialogue with citizens quotas closing the pay gap measures to combat the segregation of work in the education sector and improvements to maternity facilities for selfemployed women

in the immediate future the committee should arrange a visit to thessaloniki thus the director and officials could reassure us as to the future of c e d e f o p its viability and that it can play a useful role in research into training and retraining
it follows then that in addition to the principle of for we also have to consider the idea of for
i should point out that it is particularly painful to those of us who have long argued in favour of the usefulness and validity of an interinstitutional agreement providing credibility and stability for the unions financial framework
it is also difficult for parliament to keep track of the programmes
for this reason i ask that we vote on this report today and that we do not refer it back to committee

i should like all the same to remind you that there is still around million in the peace facility but you should be aware that our work is not finished in sudan darfur and so on
there is the issue of subsidiary but subsidiary does not mean doing
establishing specific centralized systems such as for the approval of active substances benefits everybody it means that experiments including animal experiments are not duplicated approval procedures can be more easily guaranteed and arguments and suspicions between member states can be avoided
we really would be welladvised therefore to approach the matter with some measure of humility we can offer our services but we should be careful not to adopt a didactic approach all the time
secondly now that p t o m s have failed the commission is working on an alternative base to deliver reconstruction to the north and east
and i would remind you that it was the commission which introduced the export ban in march
the proposal to delay accession that has been made by the very same people who were in favour of turkey this morning is something with which i have difficulty and i actually find it extremely arrogant
there are not at any rate many more than double the number of countries in the union that is fifteen countries
what we cannot accept however is that we are now retreating from dayton again

and therefore as long as fascist brutality goes on trying to silence those who have been democratically elected we will tirelessly go on denouncing it again and again
at the same time let me draw your attention to the commissions report on the functioning of the transitional arrangements for the enlargement of the first of may two thousand and four and in particular to the finding that the arrival of workers from the accession member states has had a beneficial effect and actually helped to reduce imbalances in national labour markets without the newcomers largely taking the place of local jobseekers

please do not be scared that by not granting discharge you will cause this commission to fall
the drivers must have a goal to aim for they must know where the finishing post lies
unfortunately these actions have not been successful in the way that was intended and in this respect i must also express our regret that the commission failed to adopt other initiatives earlier to change tack in view of the events
on the basis of concrete and operational experience the appropriate and necessary improvements should be made
de madam president mrs gy≈ëri mrs reding i fail to see the point of this debate
i am really pleased with the savings we have managed to make even though they have come about as a result of our efforts to conserve our resources
as a result of the conferences held and the activities we have been involved in regarding the enforced prostitution of women a network has been formed through which women can cooperate
this will increase even more due to the absence of an depth reform of the cap which we recommend and due to the undeniably restrictive content of the rules which will govern some of the cohesionrelated instruments
at the same time it confirms the sound choice made at the beginning of the nineteen nineties in countries such as poland where the reconstruction of capital markets was based on european standards which is now amplifying the harmonization of regulations across the european union
i also appeal from this chamber to the football authorities in romania to reverse this decision and allow politehnica timi≈üoara to remain in topflight romanian and european football

the commission acknowledges this specific identify of small businesses and that is a good thing
the very notion of lack of conformity is defined in a very subjective way in the draft directive
i would however like to draw your attention today to another problem this is a problem that is rarely mentioned when discussing broad prophylactic measures
however it is an idea which has already been taken up by the horizontal measures in agenda two thousand
this technical report is not going to solve all the problems but it is a simple first step in the right direction
and now i will give some of the reasons why we cannot accept the other amendments
we also know that the united states are currently waging a campaign in russia against the kyoto protocol
mr president we have to face facts footand mouth disease which we thought we had confined to great britain has now reached continental europe
if you look at paragraph e in the karas report i will read an extract from the paragraph whereas a better streamlined review of implementation in the form of a new implementation package requires information on the implementation of policies agreed on europe leading to an evaluation of implementation in the relevant policy areas
we could submit it to the committee on the rules of procedure the verification of credentials and immunities and open up a very interesting debate on the subject
since nineteen sixty when the draft convention on election to parliament by universal suffrage was adopted our house has produced five reports which have ended up deadlock within the council at last the spanish presidency has achieved a laborious agreement within the council

in practice the member states will be prohibited from restricting the sale in their territory of products where these are manufactured and marketed in another member state even though they may not fully comply with the rules of the member state of destination
but i do not believe as you indicated that better regulation or the longer solution to what mr von wogau was dealing with in the lamfalussy proposals can be left to the convention
i am sure commissioner verheugen that you will explain this as a misunderstanding or a misinterpretation and quite rightly point out that this represents a breach of the confidentiality you presumably agreed on
lastly we support the idea of retaining the sevenyear financial framework given that even in this area the tendency is to downward
in the current quest to replace mr santers team with another and for the distribution of interests and responsibilities to take place unless these two conditions are met control and the creation of independence releasing this commission from the grip of interests we will have the same outcomes
we really are not up to it
it is a serious attempt to get some common sense into what is a very complicated system
concludes voting time
last year we had the huge disaster of the forest fires in greece and before that we had forest fires in portugal and the floods in germany and the czech republic

that was perfectly reasonable
also important is our amendment defining the almost major accident concept that is to say a major accident avoided owing to an intervention whether or not planned in advance or owing to a chance coincidence the result of which was that the major accident did not occur
our strong belief in free trade is perfectly compatible with the need to ask for a level playing field
firstly there was overwhelming support among stakeholders for the application of the principles
unfortunately however both the commission and the council simply welcomed the report as an important contribution and did nothing about it
my pleasure
i think it is excellent and well thought out in particular when he says we should make ourselves more visible through centralized decisionmaking processes by increasing our presence with a clearer figurehead with a large effective staff and a wide remit to coordinate and take decisions
we should commit to this off our own bat
the result has been a very complete and significant agenda for the coming years
the health check simply provides an opportunity to streamline and simplify the common agricultural policy in line with the two thousand and three cap reform
then the debate on the separation of powers will be a completely different debate from what we sometimes hear now
i should also like my remark to be noted in the minutes
i am sure that the czech presidency the first council presidency by a former warsaw pact country will set about this issue with a particular sense of its responsibility and will in collaboration with its french and swedish colleagues bring this matter to a successful conclusion
it is about channelling our precious resources for research into producing weapons that are going to cause conflict in other parts of the world
the eu needs common legislation enforced uniformly in all member states for combating tax fraud and evasion
council you have the chance to get us out of this ridiculous situation and thereby enhance the union in the eyes of its citizens

today we are witnessing the moment when success will be announced
the committee on budgets also shared our concern about the use of the allocated part of the money in the cohesion area for additional funding of other projects such as the european institute of technology on the strength of a decision by the council that would be at odds with the principle of cohesion and would also deplete the european parliaments prerogatives
i have one further point to mention that is also very important to me public procurement must not result in the institutions selected losing their democratic rights
‚Äì do you believe that it is possible to solve this problem with the social partners in the context of a social dialogue ‚Äì since they are in fact mainly responsible for the problem also as far as working times are concerned
ro madam president montenegros gaining of accession candidate country status is the upshot of the open door policy promoted by the european union which has had a beneficial impact not only in eastern europe but also in the western balkans as in this case

garc√≠a m√°rquez said that wisdom comes when we no longer have any use for it
the eu is its biggest trade partner transactions between the two parties represent almost seventy of libyas trade in two thousand and nine
the review is therefore important
we must indeed raise questions as to content institutional matters will come after
the eu is a total entity and only as a whole will it be effective in establishing peace stability and progress in its neighbourhood and beyond
will a majority of eight votes suffice or will a different majority be needed
we must not forget however that in the interests of protecting the environment and limiting climate change we will ultimately have to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases that is we need to limit our use of fossil fuels rather than try to find alternatives for storing the emissions underground
in the letter of understanding that the commission forwarded to parliament and in its communication on cohesion policy and the environment the commission has listed a great many measures in relation to which as the latest discussions with the committee on the environment public health and consumer protection have shown we have definitely made some progress although this can only be recorded in future reports
this finding suggests to me that we must when dealing with these conferences and topics come to the point of really questioning our own economic development in our called wealthy countries

this is an important agreement in the fight against terrorism and it will ensure that the fundamental liberties of european citizens are protected

the definition of a terrorist has been made broader and will be able to be applied to all who resist an unjust and intolerable order
the european parliament resolution only skims the surface of the problem and tries to deal with it within liberalist parameters
recommends that there should be twenty five different collective agreements one for each country
as i said the commission does not have the facility to make this sort of intervention
i can see the attraction in an integrated approach but i share views who said that the situation is similar to what we have seen in the case of policies on issues for years anyone who did not wish to give any consideration to issues said that there was no need to do so because of gender mainstreaming everybody then waited for progressive policies on issues and equal opportunities to miraculously appear
it is also important as we debated very comprehensively and in my opinion very well in this house some time ago to pay attention to areas with specific geographical circumstances and naturally to consider the matter of demographic change in europe which is something that we will encounter very often and need to deal with
we know
as you know there has been a wideranging debate in parliament about the days on which these elections should be held

all this may not be surprising for the dissident hu j i a informs us that the head of security in beijing is also the person in charge of organizing the olympic games there

in nineteen ninety five gabon approached the european union as did madagascar about concluding an agreement on tuna
looking at the progress made i can assert that the commission has absolutely no regrets about having set itself the objective of achieving a positive declaration of assurance concerning the underlying transactions
those debates are more open and regional conflicts less frequent
this is a demonstration of european diversity and of the need to be sensitive to the realities faced by others
however we regret that other amendments have not been adopted firstly because of the heavy dependence of primary agricultural production on external factors we proposed including a clause dealing with this specific characteristic and spending the directives application to agricultural products in the case of damage resulting from natural disasters or other cases of force mature
i am rather uneasy about the fact that we talk indiscriminately in terms of eggs semen and embryos
the action of the yahoo internet portal that revealed details to the court should also be investigated

but i would like to think that my choice of words will be shared and accepted by each of these members
the danish presidency will keep a watch on this
p l mr president we are trying to help poor countries in africa and latin america with little effect but there can be no justification for failing to help the poor within the european union there are regions where people are very poor especially children
mr president the recent crisis between russia and ukraine over gas supply has shown that it is more important than ever to have a european energy market that is less dependent on imports
the european union has started using a gender tracker to track gender mainstreaming in development cooperation programmes
if the cost of wages and social dumping are the reason why do i not get to see documents in which the french authorities reprimand french customers for using too many belgian lorry drivers
subject overlapping of european parliament and meetings of the council of ministers of the forty one meetings of the council of ministers scheduled between september and december nineteen ninety nine eighteen took place or will take place when parliament is holding plenary sessions in strasbourg or brussels
two people were hung yesterday in arak and in boujerd and many more are waiting for their sentences to be carried out

when you surf you go into the sea where there are always pirates

on the contrary it seeks to make trade subject to standards for animal welfare
the second message consists in saying that in a european union of twenty five member states there can be no first and second class citizens or workers

i am referring to the extremely high import duties imposed by south korea on canned fruit

in addition i consider it necessary to proceed with the implementation of programmes to educate the population in prevention and early diagnosis of diseases and lastly i would emphasis the primary role that the authorities on the ground must play to this end
with regard to procedural rights we have focused strongly on people who get into trouble because they may have committed a crime we have been concerned to see that their rights are looked after as we should be in our rightsbased society

many members have said this already this afternoon all the opinion polls in all the european countries point to one thing it is not the french government not the german government and not the belgian government that have become isolated instead it is tony blair jos√© mar√≠a aznar and silvio berlusconi that have lost touch with european reality

this is a responsibility that i cannot and do not wish to assume

do you think commissioner that a strong institution merging the regulatory authorities such as for example as in holland where the competition authority has taken over the energy regulatory authority and the telecommunications authority would be a good model for other member states as well

on behalf of the its group n l madam president the problem of immigration is an important one and is given far too little attention during debates on the euromediterranean partnership

there is just one item in the report about which i have reservations and here i am speaking on behalf of the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe so that i do not have to repeat myself in a moment and that is what we find under recital k which suggests that we demand that immigrants and tourists subordinate themselves to european tradition and heritage this is not a good piece of phrasing

p t mr president vice president of the commission ladies and gentlemen i shall start with the report by mrs roure which i once again support in its efforts to reach a political agreement on the proposal for a framework decision on the protection of personal data in the framework of the third pillar that is not based on the lowest common denominator a minimum level of data protection and serious shortcomings
it is an excellent report because of course it condemns any kind of discrimination or racism against the roma and we like it because it promotes true integration by taking an admirable cultural approach

taxpayers whom i represent across the united kingdoms capital ‚Äì in barnet enfield croydon ‚Äì are concerned that the tax they are paying which is channelled to the european commission is not being properly accounted for

insofar as the second part of the amendment is concerned i can agree to the addition of a reference to the european parliament in the future regulation
this is nothing to reproach the december council with i evaluate it positively as i said at first but i do expect the commission to take up these ideas and be the dynamic factor for profound medium term reform of the common fisheries policy so that the desirable equilibrium can be achieved between responsible exploitation of resources and their conservation with equal opportunities for all the ships that form part of what ought to be a community fleet that is a european fleet
