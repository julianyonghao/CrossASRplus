in the european year for intercultural dialogue we should also recognize the importance of cultural industries in creating awareness and understanding of other cultures and therefore their importance for social cohesion
– the european union and the international community are preparing to write off some of debts and at this moment the debts of the countries ravages by the tsunami
this must not happen we must proceed with all transparency for the very reason that the european citizens expect the decisions taken by the highest assembly that is the decisions taken by the council then to be rapidly implemented or europes credibility will fall even more
another of the aspects dear to my own heart is the move towards establishing a far greater input into the decisionmaking process by fishermen scientists and conservationists
discussions in the council have focused on the anticipated financial impact of the proposed market measures and the financial aspects of the main elements of the reform proposals from linked payments gradual reduction and modulation
mr president this is the same as if we were to debate the assignment of radio frequencies and the association agreement with egypt at the same time because they are both the remit of the committee on industry external trade research and energy
i will turn now to the scientific aspect of this discussion
we hope that the commission will propose an action programmer that is specific to the elderly and which takes account of all these aspects in an integrated vision having listened to organizations representing pensioners and the elderly

mr president todays debate is probably the most important of all the debates in which i have had the honour of taking part since entering this house
we have had previous debates in the past two months where the council was present but left the debate halfway through
but we want to make sure that the currency we are creating is a citizens currency something that the people in the european union feel confident with and feel is acting on their behalf
whoever has confidential information at their disposal does well to protect that confidential information
mr president i wish to emphasis that our group is actually present but for the same reason as the group of the progressive alliance of socialists and democrats in the european parliament we have decided not to participate in the vote to indicate our opposition to the fact that the debate has taken place just like the votes
i would like to make a final comment madam president on an absolutely essential point which we were able to raise in the euro mediterranean forum which followed the forum held by the council where we were able to speak with our colleagues parliamentarians from both sides of the mediterranean
madam president i welcome the progress in drawing up the new european treaty and the agreement that has been reached which is roughly along the lines suggested
the commission unreservedly supports the strengthening of the role of the parliamentary assembly in relations with the mediterranean partners increased ownership is also essential
the opinion is often expressed that social partners and in particular trade union organizations should be closely involved in all measures in order to help solve the problem of social exclusion indeed the question of whether they should take over the functions of state and local authority has even been considered

these two reports are important because they are about ensuring that vehicles in europe are improved
this report is along the right lines as it shows the european parliaments will to fully contribute to this end

i believe that the finnish presidency is a good example of how to act on the european level to promote deeper integration and how to achieve deeper integration whilst also opening the european union to the outside world
i understand from the report that these estimates are subject to a great deal of uncertainty
regarding eurostat i note the proposal to define the nature of political responsibility and the reform of the nonetheless i am surprised that a new instrument amounting in practice to a duplication of olaf is now being proposed
i particularly commend those meeting sections relating to the consumers obligation to notify any fault within two months because there is a clear problem of practicability here the renewal of guarantees for any goods supplied to replace faulty goods because obviously the same conditions should apply and the removal of article thirty five of the common position which prevents the consumer having the contract of sale rescinded if a fault is minor because a minor fault might be repeated time after time throughout the guarantee period
it would be a disaster if they managed to gain support for their deadly cause from pashtun groupings who might feel rejected by the new leaders of afghanistan

we have reached a stage where we can no longer afford further rescue packages
manufacturers must indicate the products energy consumption regardless of whether they are more efficient green or less efficient pink from an energy perspective

when a position is adopted many factors must be taken into account
you supported me on numerous issues – as we discussed at the time – and acknowledged that i was right in many instances as with the campaign on parliamentary reform with which you were associated and which you often took up as an issue
i believe that none of you would consider me to be anti european if i were to pose a few questions
in the next few months we will have the opportunity to improve the text of this directive even more but the most important thing at the moment is to speed up the timescale for its implementation as much as possible and guarantee the technical economic and administrative resources which will be needed for it to be put into practice rigorously and effectively
however i would still like to say a few words on the health aspects with regard to nickel in the outer layers of the coin
we have postponed the discharge because e m e a is clearly having problems in terms of procurement procedures its procurement procedures for several projects have been fraught with errors which corresponds to the significant amount of e u r thirty million

yet again we are compelled to raise our voices to condemn the atrocities committed in burundi
precisely as a result of this general consensus which was reached by means of a complex series of bilateral and multilateral compromises the report should not be subjected to changes at the present time and it is therefore desirable that it is adopted in full
i briefly wanted to comment on the most important responses
as you will appreciate this is a real debate
i hope that our joint efforts will be rewarded with a constructive spirit and a desire for compromise among all our institutions
repression regrettably has a long tradition in russia and was to assume appalling and criminal dimensions during the soviet era especially under stalin
however it is also a question of russias credibility when it comes to whether we can move forwards with the negotiations for a new partnership and cooperation agreement and how the policy on the four common areas and the question of human rights can be included
how then can the european central bank set a common interest rate suitable for a europe with widely varying economies arising from such great geographical diversity and widely differing ways of life

terrible conditions are being experienced
despite this i do not think we should operate at national level but should cover a wider level
and although i can understand that if we carry on along this road we shall find it hard to make any progress what is certain is that the national parliaments essentially came into being because taxes had to be fixed and they are not likely easily to accept a role in which they are merely required to rubberstamp decisions taken by supranational authorities

we are deeply sorry about this
i should like the white paper to be based on approximately the same principle so that each product can be traced and seen in its context finite or renewable raw materials the supply of energy what form of energy is used chemicals the flow chart for the product logistics et this is especially important for very large volumes of products consisting in actual fact of food water and household chemicals
antisemitism racism and xenophobia are not in decline in europe

during the crisis the e c b adjusted interest rates down to one and continued unprecedented nonstandard measures to support credit throughout two thousand and nine
by putting in place a european research area we reduce the risk of those who develop innovative projects going and looking for their sources of funding elsewhere it is a way of giving a dramatic boost to growth and competitiveness

it seems to me that since both of these issues are of some interest and substance we run the possibility of running over on the time originally allocated
i hope the commission will support the point of view of the european parliaments committee on the environment public health and consumer protection
for many people of modest means opel represents an affordable brand
the commission initially proposed applying exceptional measures for a period of three years
undoubtedly these are important questions for the unions economy particularly during the crisis
in addition the new direct payments for energy crops and nuts introduced with the cap reforms will be covered by the same gradual phasingin arrangements these countries will no longer have the opportunity for derogation with regard to the single farm payment which implies greater discrimination and has already led to objections from the czech republic poland slovenia and estonia
however in the debate there was also another europe mr president which i call the europe of the three c s the europe of conflict condemnation and contempt
finally my third point

these new and necessary institutional developments or completely new institutions such as the particularly important military corps that has just been decided on could lead to dilemmas as to how to divide power between national and community authorities but let us not forget the message of emu community institutions are only successful when the principle of subsidiary is applied and when the power of the larger partners is counterbalanced by protecting the rights of the smaller partners
the most serious aspect of your governments management in galicia is that the state had no plans or instruments to address the crisis immediately

energy is the basis for all economic and industrial development
we are building the single market first and foremost for the people of europe not for the sole benefit of large companies
animals are not commodities

author mr president i would like to focus the houses attention on the recent announcement by the commission to apply wholebody imaging technology to europes airports by twenty ten
we must say no to the closing of human beings

they yearn for alternatives
on others like the issue of the irish commissioner they took a worstcase scenario arising from the implementation of the treaty
mr president ladies and gentlemen after ten long days of negotiations a protocol was agreed in kyoto to reduce the gas emissions responsible for global warming the protocol was signed by thirty eight countries out of the one hundred and sixty represented at the world summit
this decision is even more of a success since it entails much greater harmonization of management of the radio spectrum on a european scale which as if we needed any reminding is an increasingly scarce resource
for that reason i would like to make three points firstly we do not need two administrative bodies for one agency secondly decisionmaking must be carried out where the work is being done that is to say at the kosovo reconstruction agency in kosovo and thirdly it is important to work in cooperation with the local people and more particularly on a multiethnic basis as has been emphasized here
fifthly and finally you need to put a floor in the market for our intensive sector with export refunds extended immediately to meat and hams

i commend mr menrad and the committee on employment and social affairs for their work on employee rights

there is just one more issue which i want to mention because it touches my portfolio taxation

this is therefore the way to resolve – or to include – the israel palestine issue too in a more overall solution
although the report recommends that soft law should not be used in official community documents and that the distinction between dura lex and dolls lex should not be recognised i do not consider this to be a relevant issue the difference between binding and nonbinding acts of the community is a matter of fact and this recommendation does not change either the reality of their existence or their essence
that is not quite true
it should be made available immediately and it should be complementary
mr president i greatly appreciate the opportunity to be with you in parliament today
despite all the good efforts made by the commission and by us m e p s we can clearly see that information is not reaching ordinary citizens
yes mrs doyle the presidency is totally motivated in this direction this will be achieved by way of the directives that we are working on at the present time namely the i p p c directive the proposal for a soils directive and the energyclimate package as i am reminded of the link with climate change
that is why we in conjunction with the e d n group and mr macartney have proposed an amendment calling for a mr review of the agreement
i think that report represents an additional strong signal of support from the european union at this challenging moment for the un
i am satisfied that the compromise adopted by the council involves an important role for the national regulatory authorities
it is therefore an urgent matter all the more so because this directive is a key factor in the fight against illegal copying a matter particularly close to my heart and because pirate copying is the scourge of the information society

it is vitally important to get the investment services directive right because the rewards will be an increased return for savers and cheaper products for consumers

mr president regarding the coup détat in fiji there are three points we should consider
the riches of the country are being blundered by friend and foe alike for example the coltran that we use in our mobile phones and military equipment is being mined and exploited by the rwandans in the kivu to their own advantage
thank you for that encouraging and positive response but i have to say that it is disappointing that the council is weakening the proposals before parliament particularly by reducing the level of the targets and making them nonbinding
our diagnosis is complete and the treatment must now begin
there is no progress without water
what is that
we are well aware that the assurances we enjoyed in the past cannot be guaranteed for the future and we have to be ready to form a society that is still able to prosper in circumstances that are no longer the same as in the present or past
the agreements must also be monitored at parliamentary level by a joint committee comprising members of both the european parliament and the united states congress

the commission recently opened the second meeting of the citizens energy forum in london
de mr president mr pieper i am surprised to hear you say that mrs krehl must be dreaming
it was not an end in itself but simply one stage further along the road to european integration
as i interpret the situation the councils reply to my question is therefore that a common defence policy is not on the agenda for the near future
the proposal also makes major technical improvements for example notifications crossborder mergers and the grouping of funds via masterfeederstructures the harmonization which will be thus achieved will also guarantee equitable competition conditions across the european union provided as our rapporteur has stated that actions are taken at a fiscal level to avoid distortions
following the parliament and the commission have worked hard to structure and develop what should become a common policy on immigration and asylum
whilst the proposal from my point of view does not go far enough it signals the end of the existing battery cage system of production
ukraine will never be the same again
at their meetings on the fourteenth of september and the sixteenth of october the transport ministers had already discussed the consequences for this sector of the attacks on the eleventh of september as had the european council of economic affairs and finance ministers at its meeting on the twentyfirst of september with a view to issuing a rapid and coordinated response from all member states which would make it possible to support the structuring of the sector while at the same time trying to retain the basis for healthy competition
that is because there will be a real need for everyone of frustrate ability whether they be in the european parliament s delegation to the convention or on the committee
then there is the clean slate a provision that ends the unfortunate practice of deducting advances from featured artists royalties
ladies and gentlemen that ruling was a major setback for community interests it was a major setback for this parliament and for the european commission

mr president ladies and gentlemen we are discussing taken together three sectors which are of enormous importance in the european unions production system the chemical industry the automobile manufacturing industry and the maritime industries
it is impossible to take in principle anything but a critical position with regard to this regulation this critical position is justified by the current situation of the fisheries sector and by the proposals that are being made to us in this regulation even though they are not very specific
it often seems as if they are just words which do not appear to have a lot of content

i regard the energy alliance as very important indeed but as not going far enough
it is also quite staggering that such technologically gifted people i am thinking here of the software sector for example allow their children to be socially and sexually exploited to such a dreadful extent

secondly we should pay attention to the question of the awareness of citizens and the necessity of change in the area of ecological issues research carried out at the time of the climate conference in poznań last year showed that society does regard climate change as a serious problem but thinks that solving this problem is a matter exclusively for the authorities
we do know the sort of people we are dealing with here and the institutions thus need to be aware in relation to inspections that they represent a higher risk and must therefore be subject to strictly inspections
the conventions work has also been guided in a very positive manner
on the contrary the reduction of the irregular employment of foreigners has resulted in additional income for national budgets
it is more that we try to give a hook to member companies because the aid does not go to the member states themselves

the numerous officials in the commission who deal with external relations taking on competencies of prime importance are technical specialists but in general they lack the prior diplomatic training which is necessary to fulfill their duties

secondly the rapporteur states quite rightly that the protection of tourism is a central aspect of any policy of this type if we also want to compete against other tourism in terms of quality and safety he then goes on to state as a secondary premise that the nineteen million nine hundred and sixty one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight consumer policy says nothing about tourism although this protection aspect is probably the weakest part of the legal context within which the development of the tourism phenomenon takes place

the honorable member will certainly understand that some instructions which are addressed to authorities with external frontier controls for example are by nature confidential and therefore not accessible to the public

their position on aid to their air transport sector is unacceptable and contrary to fair competition at international level
first of all we have to see how to guarantee this funding
this is a very important stage in the new european unions coming into being and i think we have managed to specify what paper and pencils are to be used where the entrances will be which architects to appoint and what they can do and when they can do it on the road towards standardized financial services
however i would like a clarification from the commissioner on something that i am not sure about
this is nevertheless a minimalist directive with relatively modest objectives
mr president zimbabwe is a land of tragedy and a land of tyranny

when faced with those who sow the seeds of terror death and destruction in our societies there is only one dialogue possible the dialogue that arises from the implementation of the law

subject nuclear power stations
nevertheless i welcome the progress that this report represents as far as consumer protection is concerned particularly the introduction of rules for combating energy poverty and for ensuring transparency and accessibility to information for the end user
for all these reasons we voted against the report
the present block exemption is also unnecessarily detailed in its formal requirements resulting in unnecessary legal uncertainty

i would like to address those related to the increased security measures practised in some airports throughout the eu
however it is also true that coastal fisheries have handicaps and i agree with most of your conclusions in this respect

traditionally they have been used by governments and some local authorities as an agency for the payment of state pensions and other benefits as well as a local collection centre for house rents local taxes and so on but as the modernization of public financial systems leads to more and more electronic cash movements straight to and from bank accounts so the viability of rural post offices is being threatened

i am delighted that you have reiterated the commitment to better legislation but we need action
the committee on the environment public health and food safety wants euratom just to focus on nuclear safety and research into the treatment of nuclear waste
we must put their development their modernization and their competitiveness at the heart of our economic strategy
mr president denmark is not a party to the eus regulatory framework on asylum because in june nineteen ninety two we exercised the peoples democratic right to reject a situation in which the eu would determine the member states asylum regulations

in my trips to iraq i have heard kurdish sunni shia christian turkman leaders and others complain about the role of the peoples mujahedin as a tool of saddam hussein in the nineteen eighty eight anfar campaign which culminated in massacres such as halabja
i should like to say by way of justifying the proposal tabled by the group of the european party christian democrats and european democrats that we want the member states to have the opportunity to table their own proposals and to submit them to the commission for approval after all the member states know the situation best
we should leave things where they belong
it therefore makes sense that the european parliament which has always regarded itself as the patron saint of democracy in latin america and elsewhere should express its views on this

this is likely to spur the deployment of clean technologies in developing countries

the chairs of the political groups will outline their respective positions on this issue
the french version already contains the words i wish to add the members of the commission
mr president speaking as an italian and since you referred to the countries involved in the problems of the balkans i just want to say that as well as france germany and the united kingdom austria and italy are also involved and they are crucial countries in the area
on the basis of this encouraging observation the general orientation is aimed as your chamber recommended in its annual economic report at giving new impetus to the economic strategy of the european union
it is quite clear that the european steel industry is a very important component of our economy and in its own way of our european identity

to put it in a nutshell people in greece ireland and portugal have the feeling that they are suffering because the structure of our bank system is weak
other objectives such as the protection of the environment and the protection and welfare of animals and plants are all very laudable commissioner but if they do not affect food safety there is other legislation which deals with them or which can potentially deal with them
my third point concerns the reassert theory to which only seven member states remain committed only seven
member states are also required to protect copy protection under the law

however i repeat that my group is agnostic and will have a free vote on the matter
again to come closer to citizens we also have to express ourselves not in eu jargon but in plain language and i hope this will help

member of the commission i think your angle is absolutely right because if you go to a fitness centre today even before you actually get to the machine you see the shelves full of different kinds of products dietary supplements energy drinks and so on you are absolutely right that this area is very big business and that we should think very carefully about how to approach it and how to find an appropriate balance in offering the possibility for sports people to have good products but at the same time ensuring that they have proper information about what kind of products they are using
why has nothing been done about it
it was also decided to reject the proposal to replace the decision by a regulation since the fact that the measures are adopted as a decision has no effect on their efficacy

it is also important that the commission should rapidly take steps to guarantee that states are able to extend enterprise and transport aid to the island regions
indeed the disadvantage of these guidelines as i understand it is that thus far they have no legal force in the member states

these related in particular to the issue of closed animals in food and feed with regard to which the amendments adopted today and voted for by me introduce the necessary consumer guarantees on the origin of ingredients used in production processes
in writing l t i voted in favour of this document because it contributes to the necessary simplification of the eu legal framework

before the vote on paragraph seven

state of relations between turkey and the eu
here we are working towards a european position that reflects europes strength and this question will have to be included in the international discussions on financial market reform
even after it has expired its spirit must live on
in particular a system of this kind would strengthen the fight against fraud and we all know how important that is we feel sure it is the right system to adopt despite a certain confusion which emerges every now and then on condition that it is based on the simplest possible mechanism both as regards public administrations hence the compensation mechanisms others have already mentioned and in particular obviously as regards the obligations on firms
we are however realistic enough not to think that introducing a single customs administration is a possibility
the criticism of them is justified
of course there are other models which fall short of our expectations at european level of that there can be no doubt and something needs to be done here
should we be content with acknowledging but not hearing what these women are asking for either in their own countries or in seeking protection through the international law that we support

convention to combat desertification debate
i can tell you that the beginning of the discussions was just about the coordination of national regulators and after i insisted the commission was asked to come up with scopes and modalities and also given the task of presenting before the end of the year a full report on the findings

if the president succeeds in both reinforcing his own power base and achieving an economic recovery by carrying out central reforms in ukraine which is of course one of the poorest countries of this continent he will perhaps keep himself on his presidential throne for longer and i believe that that would be something that plainly and simply the european union would have to take note of
we shall see instances of structuring
economic globalisation has already made it possible for developing countries to share in the prosperity of rich countries and will continue to do so in the future

mr president i feel i must comment on the report by mr bösch on the protection of the communities financial interests and the fight against fraud the report has a coherence of its own it has some qualities and a fair evaluation has already been made of it this evening in this debate
as far as i can see this all smacks more of what one might call national nepotism in other words that there are a number of member states that wish to have some staff placed somewhere in particular and the other member states are therefore nodding this through

most people in employment have internet access and there are lots of internet courses for pensioners
therefore these statistics need to be adapted and we are going to adapt them in line with demand for energy
the first that i will mention is mine clearance operations
i know some of my colleagues here have doubts or worries concerning the credibility or sincerity of some of the people involved in the pharmaceutical industry however at every stage in human health development when there has been a need or a desire to respond to a risk to human health they have come up with solutions and answers and we should listen to what they have to say
we wish to ensure that the community has effective means to support this structuring at community level

naturally i very much hope as do the rapporteurs and my fellow committee members that the council will write this letter and submit this declaration accordingly so that we can actually conclude the matter and do not wind up in a conciliation procedure after all on the basis of the compromise which has now been achieved
we can only lament the fact that we were never heeded and our suggestions never taken up or even considered
mr president ladies and gentlemen may i point out that mr cunha did not put a direct question but since i do not agree with his last statement i would like to make the following clear it may be true that expenditure on those environmental measures that are currently summarized under regulation twenty seventy eight is only rising by a certain amount but it is also true that this results in a whole range of other additional expenditure for instance an extra incentive for extensive beef production

what conclusions should we draw in terms of continuing the work one thing is certain whether there is another ministerial conference now or whether work has to proceed on a stepbystep basis never again can another working round be allowed to open without there being a clear agenda which has been put to the vote and agreed

we also support the call for a regulatory costimpact assessment by the commission and by parliament for its amendments
i also see that there is a clear domestic debate from the u k in here it would be tempting to go into that but i will not do so
but i want in particular if i may to address my remarks to mr jouyet for his declaration today that president sarkozy who comes here tomorrow will attend the opening ceremony of the olympic games

the number of errors has fallen but we have still not reached the tolerable error level
the debate on resources and the participation of private capital is wool over the workers eyes
it is not enough to contain terrorism although i have no doubt of the power of our states to do so
like you we believe that this is not just linguistic it is a different concept so if we cannot have the withdrawal of the corrigendum we would like to have it referred back to committee for clarification

however i have a number of doubts as to whether the compromise achieved following lengthy and difficult negotiations will contribute to the protection of human health and the environment on the one hand and to encouraging competition and innovation within the chemical industry in the european union on the other
we have to build this mutual trust with the legislation and with the measures to boost the rights of citizens in all our member states so that the judges also implement the rules we have been looking for and yes we are advancing very quickly on this

in other words we do not wish antidemocratic processes to develop and gather strength
but there is no way in which the implementation of that objective which is a particularly difficult one to achieve should come under an integrated approach as recommended by the titley report
the commission will therefore not stand in the way of an agreement but would be reluctant to accept all the proposed increases relating to intervention
in this respect as you will know the european parliament is working on an initiative to form a common diplomatic corps of the community this is clearly not intended to replace the diplomatic services of the member states but to complement these and possibly improve their coordination
the council the commission and parliament have been lamenting this situation for years but little or nothing has as yet been done about it

there are nonetheless a couple of points on which the committee responsible has arrived at odd results
it is important to seize this opportunity as far as possible
madam president ladies and gentlemen the fourçans report is important not only because it fully endorse the commissions recommendations but also because it plays a clear part in the political debate that has caused a great stir among european circles including within this parliament the debate focuses on whether or not the introduction of the our has given rise to the need to relax the budgetary and monetary discipline that led to the historic decision of may nineteen ninety eight with a view to promoting a more tentative form of economic activity

we would like the council to come forward with the right kind of conclusions so it can be included in the two thousand and three procedure this along with other reforms will help to prepare our institution for enlargement
the prerequisite for this is the dissolution of the euratom treaty which is used to promote the expansion of the nuclear industry
it is worrying that the bombing has aggravated the situation and we should recognize that it was a mistake on the part of n a t o and the european union to take such action
presidentin office of the council p t as the honorable member will know in may two thousand and seven the commission presented to the european parliament to the council and to the committee of the regions a communication on circular migration and mobility partnerships between the european union and third countries
mobility is important within the eu and so is the fight against protectionism
it is important that our actions in the commission and in parliament are targeted on the areas where the problems are
financial support and the simplification of legislative procedures for scientific development should be a priority for the eu
i regret a certain insensitivity on the part of the european commission and at a national level the poor management of this process by the portuguese government our leaders ability to take action and support national interests is particularly important in times of crisis
international economic interests are far from innocent parties hovering like vultures ready to share out the vast natural wealth hidden in that part of africa
i do not want to belittle anything the commission has done i think it has made this a priority what i would ask though is that examples like the dutch example of encouraging prosecutions encouraging i s p s to be free to go after these people none of this i feel is coming back to consumers
inflation has risen to record levels and now stands at around four which is significantly higher than the inflation target of around two in the medium term
i have some sympathy with that remark perhaps we should ask the rules of procedure committee to look at the precise procedural methods we use here
i agree with what mr schulz said we need much more coordination
for this reason the european union must work in cooperation with the governments of developing countries and include respect for core labour standards in its cooperation agreements with third countries
the eu must get on board the moving train of research and application or it will leave without us
madam president i am speaking now because i believe that i can propose a solution that is quite correct
this strategy aims at better spending of eu money not increasing expenditure
turkey must be offered a preaccession strategy accompanied by more financial support and a friendlier political environment
but in some instances higher courts overturn these initial verdicts and act more leniently in accordance with democratic principles
there is an urgent need for the european union to stem the brain drain effectively and to put in place all appropriate measures to attract excellence to eu soil
the digital libraries initiative is an example of how europe can contribute through concrete projects not only to economic growth but also to quality of life
i hope they will do so during the vote even some members of political groups who have not supported that compromise because the situation at sellafield is serious
in this way the union would also be in a better position to coordinate monetary policy with its international partners and to bring about a reform of the international monetary system
the rapporteur has once again demonstrated his great experience in this field and his capacity for reaching consensus by achieving a large majority in the committee on industry research and energy
it has to be said that parliamentary monitoring is not enough but the green group would not like to think that the right solution would be to integrate the schengen agreement as such into the european union since there are fundamental problems related to this agreement from the citizens point of view not dissimilar to those relating to the europol cooperation
in conclusion ladies and gentlemen i should like to take the opportunity of asking members most sincerely to join the commission in seeking to avoid any further inflammation of public anxiety by its comments or actions thereby further aggravating the problems associated with b s e
es madam president i would like to begin by congratulations you on your election and also mrs záborská on the work she has done on her report which unfortunately once again points out that also in the public institutions there continues to be inequalities between men and women in positions of responsibility
apart from the improvements to vessel standards that the report addresses the risk of human error must also be minimized
we very much look forward to strengthening and expanding this cooperation even further
hu i wish to draw attention to a matter concerning mr diamandouross report on his activities in two thousand and five on which the european parliament has already adopted a resolution this year
why has he been in prison for so long without any evidence being brought against him
we are not aiming for more petitions we are aiming for petitions that have substance and are political
if we move in this direction the disagree regime is an essential element in deepening relations between the eu and taiwan
it also concerns the adoption of council decision two million eight thousand six hundred and sixteen j a i on the implementation of decision two million eight thousand six hundred and fifteen j a i on the deepening of crossborder cooperation particularly in the fight against terrorism and crossborder crime and its annex fifty million six hundred and two thousand and nine
there are promising ideas that merit further research in the pipeline and it is important for the member states to work together much more in this area
what this quite simply means is that if we allow this first step then there will be no end
this is to be welcomed because it will give the various national authorities a greater interest in exchanging information with the network not least because they will be able to air their concerns at european level
mr president mr vice president of the commission i too should like to make use of the short time available to me to thank the rapporteur for his professional and competent work
for this reason the idea of extraordinary legalisation is a case of good intentions and a bad outcome this is a small prize for illegal immigrants and a major triumph for smuggling rings
the commission takes the view that it is highly unlikely that papua new guineas exports will cause any serious disruption to the eus fishing and canning industry given the low volume of trade between papua new guinea and the eu and papua new guineas low market share in the eu tuna market of around three in recent years provisional application dates from two thousand and eight and we have some experience with figures
therefore i feel that the next step should be to set up a system or at least to encourage manufacturers to voluntarily provide consumers with as much additional information as possible so that we can safeguard public health within our european union
besides this is clear from the settlement agreement on the extraterritorial helms burton and d amato laws and also emerges from the provisions for agriculture and for the optoacoustic industry
will the other twenty six then have to give up their ambitions
article one hundred and ninety two lays down in general terms that the member states are to inform the other member states and the commission of the actions taken by them to achieve the objective set out in paragraph one
we call on both sides to respect the ceasefire of the seventh of september last year and particularly demand that the leader of the f n l agathon rwasa should fully engage in the peace process
the committee on legal affairs and citizens rights is quite unanimous that this common position is not in the interests of parliamentary democracy or transparency and it is not democratic it simply undermine the position of parliament
as we conclude this stage an equally promising stage is beginning that requires our full commitment
recent years have shown no sign of the coordination called for in the maastricht treaty and nor does maastricht i i
i myself have proposed that the eu should join the arctic council
i should like to point out chiefly in my role as coordinator of the group of the european peoples party christian democrats for regional policy that our objectives must be retained in full
at least with some of the concepts we have crossed an important bridge
f r mr president ladies and gentlemen several european regions have been hit by some exceptional natural meteorological phenomena which have resulted in huge material economic agricultural and environmental damage and have sadly claimed too many human lives
that is why we must adhere to the conditions we set for ending the military action
the same applies to category five you cannot plan ahead meaningfully you have neither the means nor the willingness to do so
this must be regarded as unilateral it must be done as a single unit and this must be discussed
in this sense tourism should play a positive role in wider communications in getting to know other nations customs mores and cultures in helping to develop friendly relations between nations and in promoting popular culture and history and a healthy and creative synergy between tourism and the environment
as mr bernd lange stated a moment ago the substitution principle is essential
italys contribution will increase by approximately e u r seven hundred and fifty seven million and that of france by e u r four hundred and fifty eight million
second promoting sound policies and strategies linking climate change and development i am of the opinion that climate resilience and lowcarbon policies must be integrated into wider developments and the poverty reduction strategies of our partners
only when the transnistria conflict is resolved and moldova can genuinely protect its own borders once more will it have the chance to develop economically
the report emphasises the importance of the switchover from analogue which is on track in the u k but lagging in some other eu member states
this is why i shall be voting for rejection of the common position
not once since war broke out in chechnya eighteen months ago has poul nielson found time to visit the country to take stock of the tragedy that is unfolding there in my opinion this does the commission little credit
i believe her and so i voted for the motion
what is required is that the member states in fact behave in accordance with what they properly understand to be their own interests there is no reason for trying to get other countries to fund them out of common budget resources
they made our lives very difficult on that score a lot of discussion eventually turned out not to be necessary
a lot of the work has already been mechanized and the cost of port labour forms only a negligible part of the cost of goods these days but they even want to cut back on this
it is an urgent matter and i would therefore request the commission to make enquiries as to when that report will be presented to the transport committee
ever since the palestinian leadership started the second two and a half years ago in order to achieve their goals by violent means nearly one thousand israeli men women and children have been killed by poisoned minds with shrapnel grenades around their waists
we have to know who will be included in the system and it is obvious that it must involve countries and individual installations
in item seven there is a specific provision on the appointment of the new commission
this should not mean however that national parliaments are excluded from the legislative procedure or are restricted merely to transpiring directives adopted in this area at community level
p l madam president european programmes which support young people call for unqualified support
because if we do that you cannot come along afterwards and say that any form whatsoever of agricultural aid is undesirable
i welcome the gradual adaptation of new technologies on board fishing vessels and the undertaking to grant community aid for the development of these technologies and the specific training required
p l madam president an institution that is not operating properly must be reformed to ensure that it serves all stakeholders and consumers correctly
community research into coexistence is studying appropriate measures to segregate authorized g m crops from conventional and organic crops in a feasible and practical way
in my opinion it is good to have this option and when it comes to defining this regionalpolicy aspects should be included this is because as i said there must be no ensuing obstruction of transport such as to hamper the economy in certain regions of europe
parliament established its position as an equal arm of the budgetary power and as an equal participant in the budgetary procedure and the credit for this should go to our predecessors in particular to terence wynn chairman of the committee on budgets
furthermore together with the principle of financing it advocates the renationalisation of cap costs this is a principle that we reject
this work must also make inroads in the eus own organization
we were therefore certainly not voting against the person who is someone we admire but against an institution that we cannot accept and in fact positively condemn
that convention will be holding its first session on the twentyeighth of february in the european parliament in brussels
its pretty laughable really
the total community financial contribution will be e u r four hundred and thirty million broken down into e u r eighty six million per year for the period of the application of the protocol
firstly regarding the issue of taxation of crossborder mergers the commission will undertake to examine the potentially adverse impact that national taxation systems may have on crossborder mergers and use its funds once the proposed provisions are adopted
for all four crop categories the proposal is the result of careful reflection and is in tune with the gap reform package that was adopted last june
i would rather work to increase compliance with the key human rights conventions the content of which clearly also applies to domestic workers
following changes to the united states support system that were in my view very intelligent we need to review our internal support to examine to what extent the g a t t agreement is being respected and to assess the effect of aid on market prices and the competitive positions of commodities
the injustice lies in how the burden is distributed
that is what makes it impossible to break the circle of terror which every day as mr belder and mrs schroedter said pushes young chechens to despair young people who have seen their parents brothers and cousins killed in grozny or in other towns in chechnya kidnapped and raped by the russian forces
mr president i wish to speak as a member of the joint delegation with romania in giving my opinion on the excellent report drafted by our colleague pierre bernard reymond
following up the last question what is it that the council has to fear about a proper impact assessment so that we might know the real impact of your proposals on food production in europe
that is the main problem which puts the european social model european democracy and european integration at risk if we think about europe having a high level of social and territorial cohesion
we would also call for a far more intensive cultural exchange to prevent the asem process from remaining an elicit affair
the other topic of debate is the reduced vat rate for labourintensive services
now however the classifications of substances reflect their actual potential danger as well as can be expected
lastly mr president i should also like to ask about the letters proposals namely an international conference on the middle east situation and the mobilization of an international force such as n a t o or under chapter v i i of the un charter charged with upholding a ceasefire and keeping the peace
we need an coefficient industrial policy providing production capacity across the eu in a sustainable manner and reducing the unions energy dependency
but we must do that all together and sensitively
the extension of the programmer to more countries the greater importance of european cooperation in youth work and the more generous age limits make it necessary for the financial framework to be increased to – as has already been said – one thousand one hundred and twenty eight billion but i would like to emphasis that in this we are being consistent with the böge report
it must remain a matter for the member states to decide what powers they wish to cede to the eu ardor the commission this cannot be changed by judgments by the european court of justice which seems to have been pursuing the principle of a centralized state in its judgments for years
i would like to report that the commission is committed to keeping the european parliament fully informed at all stages of the negotiation and conclusion of international agreements
i would urge my fellow m e p s to support the strikers in friesland
the rapporteur who has been monitoring this area over several sessions of parliament believes that although there remain unresolved issues that justify regular monitoring these do not constitute an obstacle to the accession of bulgaria and romania to the schengen area
it stops here i regret that poland was excluded but it was due to technical reasons
the british government has an obligation to spend money wisely it is singularly failing in this operation
in this regard our plans are progressing well
we europeans can only meet the challenges of globalisation if we are united and secondly because exporting stability to neighboring regions is not just a historic and moral responsibility for europe but also lies in our own best interests
i very much hope that we will be able by means of better labeling to achieve a maximum of legal certainty and clarity for the consumers
i should first mention the european currency act where i am glad to say that both the commissions drafts make it very apparent that we want the our to have a clear legal status more legal certainty and transparency
if we are not very careful we are in danger of actually destroying the basis of ecological production and of general agricultural production throughout europe
we have to jointly focus on two areas

i just wanted to mention that point to demonstrate to you all that time is a great healer however that will certainly not cure my stomach ache
the european car industry is not opposed to the ambitious environmental targets that the european commission has put forward in its proposal
it is clear that a great many soldiers are being killed in afghanistan including soldiers from my country from poland far too many of these soldiers are being killed our strategy is costing too much money and n a t o s strategy is also questionable
we need the facts and figures the need to speed up goes without saying there is no need even to mention it as we are aware of that
we have full confidence in the united nations mediator mr nimitz who has a clear mandate to facilitate talks between the two parties in the framework of the two critical resolutions of the un security council from nineteen ninety three
your words presidentin office remind me of what was said in this chamber in december two thousand with regard to the adoption of the joint resolution on afghanistan
these discrepancies must be overcome by common rules to allow audit bodies and central banks to face up to the possible insolvency of the banking system particularly in countries that have adopted the our
de mr president i have just one question if the irish say no again how often must they keep going to the polls
has the time not come for a real eu policy for example on arms supplies
we are governed by that nineteen eighty six resolution which is still pertinent and very much to be supported
on the other hand it should be possible to provide what the transport ministers have requested namely an impact analysis partly with regard to employment and partly with regard to taxes since the idea was that taxes should be harmonies during this period which has not been done and which may in turn have consequences for travel between different countries and consequences for ultraperipheral countries
those interested are mainly the european financial community who are today scoring an important victory insofar as they are having a longstanding demand of theirs satisfied
focusing on article two both the work of mrs emilia franziska müller and that of the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy as a whole provide a legal concept of a balanced food supplement
we fully support the strictly measures the rapporteur calls for
food safety must take absolute priority over feedingstuffs in all our discussions
we hope that this will help to further engage israel and encourage it to respond positively to the arab peace initiative
this would however mean maintaining differences between national legislations it will continue to ensure that the credit market remains a domestic and local market depriving consumers of all the advantages a single credit market could offer them
i therefore hope that the commission in its entirety can start to support the demands which have been made by parliament and which we in the e l d r group would like to clarify a little
i also welcome what you said about pooled data which is essential to ensuring that smaller institutions can take advantage of a new risksensitive framework by pooling data with similar smaller institutions
let me repeat that the amount for two thousand and one is e u r one hundred million channelled via the world food organisation and the nongovernmental organizations
why do we therefore want the other proposal that on the visa format for exceptional cases when the person travelling has no documents to be based on article one hundred century we support this because it is parliaments responsibility to do so
this means that if the maritime environment is in a bad state the fishing industry in particular will bear the brunt of this
how can the commission ensure that ultimately a single thread runs through all these policy elements so that we actually attain the objectives set in this innovation union
the other substantive point about this set of proposals from the commission is made both in the explanatory statement of the report and in the opinion of the committee on budgets it is that although the european budget pays most of the cost it does not have most of the say
the commission is very pleased with the outcome of the decision process as regards the chapters contained in its july proposal
in cases where the product is sold in combination with non geneticallymodified products the label or other accompanying document will contain information on the possible presence of g m o s

many people in the region i come from work in luxembourg belgium or france
– madam president the question is what do we want do we want a new iraq in iran

first of all our thanks and recognition are due to the european parliament it has vigorously exercised its parliamentary right of scrutiny which is only right and fitting
the aim of an e u u s data protection agreement must be to realize this to uphold and not water down the measures that we have taken and implemented in the european union

where those aims are concerned we were of course taught a hard and painful lesson in the last two summers last year we had floods this year it was fire
the reactions of consumer associations automobile associations spare parts manufacturers associations and independent repairers associations to the commissions draft regulation have been very positive
i would like to state very clearly at this point that the industry itself must make the first moves
anyone who has worked with her knows that this is not always an easy task this is not only to do with political orientation but also with as a person
mrs locatelli should therefore have asked the question what can eu institutions do for research in europe that the countries cannot do themselves there are many such questions
a government with a particular interest in this matter could easily urge the commission to submit a proposal to the council as soon as possible and then i could assure you that the council would consider the matter without any delay
i simply believe that women should have no bar to going for qualifications and should apply for posts on a totally equal basis
the next item is the statement by the vice president of the commission and high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy on the situation in the korean peninsula
the text glibly states that europe is a world leader in the fight against poverty the promotion of sustainable development human rights and governance and so on and so forth that may well be but it is not perceived as such by the rest of the world certainly not by the eu member states and i hear very many complaints that it is not so
i am in favour of the changes that are now taking place

i welcome the fact that the european data protection supervisor is to be a voting member of the advisory committee whereas the director general of eurostat has only been granted nonvoting membership this underlines the committees independence
today when we discuss the srebrenica massacre we must question the behaviour of europeans question the behaviour not of the dutch soldiers who were in srebrenica but of the un itself because while the mandate in srebrenica authorized the soldiers posted to bosnia to do everything to control the traffic and so on it did not authorize them to protect the population
i am an advocate of a europe in which the economy is gradually brought more under democratic control
it also involves the commission
a final important point on the general regulation has to do with parliaments role in the application of the structural fund regulation
further dataprotection infringements of this kind must be prevented
in many member states during the change of regimes and systems labour rules and the nature of the labour market have also undergone significant change
when we set the calendar of sittings for two thousand and eight we could decide to meet each tuesday in the city where the commission meets we could be given a report on the decisions and take all the votes requiring absolute majorities
fourth home affairs and justice
there is no doubt that it is irresponsible to spend public money european taxpayers money in order to subsidize the growing of a product which does so much harm
but this house has positions on certain items it will not relinquish
by voting in favour of the motion for a resolution on banding the ukrainian famine of nineteen thirty two nineteen thirty three as a horrific crime against the ukrainian people and against humanity we have today pasted back into the annals of european history a page ripped out by stalin

i hope that you will not allow yourselves to be lulled by amicable agreements or mere promises even when they are made by the french government
mr president i noted carefully what the rapporteur said
personally i agree with the majority of this house that we need binding targets
of course transposition periods vary
i am grateful to mr verheugen for clarifying the budgetary aspects again the european unions current treaty provides quite clearly that the eu budget cannot be used for military purposes

mr varela i believe mr prodi s visit which i think was very positive rather than reassuring the sector has made it more worried precisely because of the moment in the process when it took place such are the doubts and vacillations that the sector feels at the moment
as regards the initiative to establish a global climate change alliance however the best that can be said about is that it is pointless
this is both good and positive
i wonder whether this house cannot even expect an answer to this and i therefore wonder on behalf of all those who face those commuting problems on a daily basis whether we the commission and parliament that is should not make use of our powers and invite this council around the table to establish what we can do with the proposals which we have tabled
have they received any representations from united kingdom ministers
what is at stake is whether europe in the long term can remain and further develop as a worldclass location for research and development

on the other hand is the focus of the monitoring right b s e was able to spread because farmers trusted their own countries veterinary authorities and their morals and because they trusted feed producers while using legal and approved feed
in the forum all stakeholders will come together and reach conclusions and then we will make an assessment
as digital tachograph manufacturers were unable to supply the equipment in time however my predecessor mrs de palacio quite rightly introduced a moratorium laying down transitional measures for the member states and delaying the compulsory installation of digital tachographs in new lorries until two thousand and five
the report does not say a word about all this
sometimes one really does wonder whether it is at all possible to come up with a reasonable set of rules which everyone can accept while appreciating that they might not represent any one persons ideal solution
it will get worse if we do not do something
apart from the cartels a number of countries and economies are also creating scarcity by preventing drilling preventing exploration preventing the construction of refineries
madam president commissioner i think it is right especially after amsterdam to claim legislative parity for the european parliament with the council
the people who help me in insurance undertakings have also taken a close interest but may i assure the member that we are fully stretched in looking at the lloyds case itself

mr president as this debate has shown there are incredibly good reasons for continuing our commitment to the democratic republic of congo
but surely mr president i was given the wrong information
i therefore call for amendments nos eight and nine to be rejected
we must make sure that we get this very important legislation right and that there are no mistakes that we might discover in future
i am afraid the wrong light came on when i pressed the button
in the economic and monetary union the m has been much stronger than the e
furthermore the present government has decided there will be no referendum on this treaty change
we have just decided not to amend the rules of procedure and therefore not to add this new rule
mr president the overwhelming irish yes was not due only to a better understanding of the lisbon treaty but also to the understanding of the fact that true respect must be mutual and compassionate
that is important to our common foreign policy and our foreign trade policy alike
it is interesting to hear the commission say that they should not get involved
in conclusion i would like to clarify the fact that the situation in the mediterranean does not only involve taking action in the area of border control
to facilitate the implementation of this policy i am due to meet the ministers for energy of the a s e a n states in manila at the beginning of july to whom i will explain our priorities
there will be increased competition increased consumer choice and lower prices in financial products which the financial services action plan can deliver if we manage to get it right
rome was not built in a day however
to be cautious though i do not expect dialogue to be of any significant level are the elections at this particular stage
the european union is obliged to ensure that our relationship and agreement with mexico do not help increase problems as has happened with the usual united states intervention and more specifically with the worsening of the chiapas situation since this area is the focus of multinational interests
moreover we must act in time for if we delay taking action we may delay too long
i am never satisfied especially when it comes to environmental issues
on the goldstone report i would like to congratulate mr bildt on behalf of the presidency for praising the and i quote credibility and high integrity of the goldstone report
luckily a wave of protest has risen up against this policy in numerous countries of the european union
f r mr president i am going to focus my comments on the report by our colleague mr itälä who has done a good job

to them brussels is one place strasbourg is somewhere else
no eu law should be passed without a visible voting majority both in this parliament and in the council
the debate on the institutional architecture of enlarged europe started by identifying the need for greater efficiency
so much for my introductory remarks

he has already responded in a most clear and positive way i wonder whether he hopes to come back to parliament before the end of the presidency with some clear indication that action has been taken

inshore fishermen are very vulnerable to the implications of the designation of special areas of conservation
i am pleased with the recent attention the subject has been receiving at eu level

i shall leave it at that
secondly special emphasis is placed on what the report calls the feminisation of the struggle for human rights
it will need to be a very big field
it has to be said that the report adopted by the committee on agriculture and rural development does substantially reduce the level of coupling of aid proposed by the it goes some way towards lifting the threat to the survival of the crops
you do not have an easy life and you have embarked upon a difficult mission
so please be understanding about this
if it is negative however mr president then that would demonstrate the attitude of the current cuban government something of which the european institutions should take very good note
and here i want to stress that it will be possible to talk about social and other matters related to the implementation of the directive within the context of the advisory committee on energy that the commission is setting up with agencies from the energy sector including of course the unions
it cannot be the case in view of the increasing destitution in many a c p countries that the commission is unable to manage to get the funds made available to those who are in need of them
p l mr president mrs georgieva it is very good that we are talking about belarus here in the european parliament but talking is not enough
until now framework directive nine thousand four hundred and forty six has provided very strong protection in the internal market but the time has come to review the directive increase the level of protection and extend the same protective measures to judicial and police cooperation
this rules out the necessity of putting the designation on the front of the package
at first this focussed solely on spain
the international monetary fund warned against this very situation when it stated that if food prices remain at their current levels more than one hundred million people could die the majority in africa

i would now like to return to the issue of extending the qualified majority voting system at european council level
however mrs mckenna i will take your explanation of vote

i was glad to learn that the report on the commissions green paper on adequate sustainable and safe european pension systems would be added to todays agenda
this letting members in particular are calling for the market to be sealed off again
the new action and health plan has to take into consideration these threats that are increasing due to the occurrence of new technologies and are gaining ground in rural areas and developing countries
this report forms part of the process of adapting the workings of the e p to the increase in the number of official languages as of may with the entry of ten countries from eastern europe and the mediterranean
mr president i gladly voted for mr carnero gonzálezs report one reason is that he himself has adopted a very sound approach focusing very sharply on the rule of law the legal system and minority questions
here we have a rosé wine
this all seems to hint that in barcelona we could adopt an agreement on a formula that as has been said from the start would consist of creating a subsidiary of the european investment bank e i b which would have autonomy and furthermore would follow a process of evolution it would start with a structure and several competences which would be increased over time
whilst this compromise motion is certainly an intelligent solution i do have my doubts and a number of interventions seem to justify them as to whether it will succeed
as i have said i am generally in favour of this report and am glad that further work is to be done along these lines
over three million people will die from aids this year alone
mr president ladies and gentlemen in concluding i would like to request parliament to support amendments which will permit swift adoption of this proposal
since nineteen ninety one neither the military nor the authorities in power have succeeded in restoring calm
safety considerations must always be paramount when dealing with nuclear power
so i am not surprised to find it was not even present to listen to this appeal and that it seems to be fairly indifferent to parliaments reform project
this adjustment is extremely important not only because all the interested parties know the exact date on which the regime changes and will comply with it but also because we have a specific offer to table at the forthcoming w t o negotiations
to name but one of our concerns the commission would very much welcome a public commitment in support of president karimovs condemnation of torture
in addition one of the main headaches for the working woman is combining family with work
i would also encourage the commission to facilitate the exchange of experiences and best practices in crossborder cooperation between e n p programmes and projects on the one hand and actions taken under the european territorial cooperation objective and under the already completed interreg ia community initiative on the other
i also wish to emphasis the importance of the i c t and tourism platform proposed by the commission
i have received five proposals for resolutions pursuant to rule three hundred and seventy two of the rules of procedure
moreover i repeated what the council has said all the time namely that the ball is now in parliaments court
finally i will restate my clear firm message let us help the poorest of the poor worldwide but also in europe to access healthier food despite this difficult situation
i am not going to give more time to it
but this is a key issue getting the balance right between food production and fuel production
in the debate that took place yesterday parliament was unable to put a stop to the many war crimes and crimes against humanity that are taking place
whilst in france the debate on the competence and role of the union is particularly animated we have here with this draft directive the opportunity to demonstrate that the union is in touch with a society on the move and that it can listen and respond to its desires
the second question relates to the main challenges facing us you mentioned them yourself globalisation sustainable development technological changes and international instability
mr president i speak on behalf of my friend mr van orden and the british conservatives i also speak on behalf of the oppressed people of zimbabwe who are crying out for justice
charter flights are subject to great delays
the mass arrests have in fact deprived of their leadership the political opposition and the local human rights watch organizations challenging the patently fraudulent election
there is still no person in charge at the heart of europol terrorists are still slipping through the net of the law and there is no harmonization in the area of criminal investigation
in any event i can send you the particular details of the matter mr foster
spain has been sidelines its involvement does not seem to be consistent with its governments support for the war
it is about the way we will put together better conditions and one concrete project towards a more innovative europe
that is the point i want to make using the only opportunity for complaint now left to me as we have decided that the votes should be cast before an empty chamber causing you mr president and those who want to listen to me to waste time
madam president i would like to point out that this is of course a workerprotection issue that is the only reason that the eu is getting involved in the matter at all
but they made some comments to me on behalf of the guinean government which i was able to incorporate in the report
i should therefore like to ask the presidentin office of the council to ensure that in the council meetings the presidency exerts pressure on the member states so that they make every effort in order to maintain the free movement of goods
this situation applies in particular to the wives of selfemployed workers who assist them working in fields or in any type of tiny family business which can be found anywhere and which employ according to studies which have been carried out millions of people
speaking in general terms i will point out in response to this question that the eu has always expressed its concern about the situation in guantanamo bay and has on several occasions in its dealings with the united states stated that the treatment of prisoners should conform to the standards laid down by the geneva convention and of human rights
our rapporteur is inspired by a european ardor which some would call federalist others integrationist and i myself simply vigorous because it is consistent
in the good times their differences only increased in the bad times the pillars on which the monetary union was established were left in ruins
it is a tragic contradiction the worse someone is paid the less their ambition to seek additional training and the less ambition amongst employers to invest in it
however as mr daul elegantly put it it was the right that won the elections therefore you are on the right the situation is clear
hundreds of thousands of young people the intelligentsia are leaving the country
it is the foundation of the modern successfully functioning market economy
the experience of this first year would seem to indicate the opposite
we particularly oppose the adoption of the directive under which member states may inter alia adopt legislative measures providing for the retention of data for a limited period
we have a recent report produced at the request of parliament which shows that if you were able to reduce by fifty the nontariff barriers between europe and the united states this would have an effect which would be much larger than the doha round
it would be beneficial if we could act under one banner and with one voice i would be interested to find out from commissioner verheugen how he rates our chance of success in july
we must prevent the social exclusion of a whole generation of young people and the jeopardizing of europes economic and social future
in addition i am of the opinion that funding for a town or neighbourhood especially where community contributions are concerned should incentive
i should start by saying that we should hide nothing
i would like to point out that this is one of seven proposals on food products
support for environmental policy in rural areas yes as a structural policy but support for a single sector the agricultural sector really is out of date in my view
it also leads however to the gradual aging of the population
however we are strongly opposed to a change in its legal basis contrary to the will of the rapporteur from one hundred and thirties to one hundred a since this restricts the ability of the member states to take tougher environmental protection measures
instead we have concentrated on the quality of a few objectives and made sure that quality comes before quantity and we have done so too on the basis of the experience that each of us has committed to memory
i should like to thank all our coordinators mr brok mr hughes mrs flautre mr schmid mrs lynne who demonstrated great understanding in order to reach some sort of outcome
the health of eu citizens must be perceived as one of the key social and political factors that will determine the unions future
finally i am grateful for the speed with which the directive on late payment has been handled
on the basis of this creative cooperation we reached agreement on the modification of the statute in a relatively short time
the key issue is that the research activities are marketoriented and aimed at short to mediumterm commercial results
from an economic point of view it is far better and three times cheaper to build an overland pipeline rather than one on the seated
i would like to add that this is not a political but a technical issue
mr president we now know that the origin of our resolution was clearly unfounded but we will use the opportunity to go back to the framework decision concerning the prevention of trafficking in human organs and tissues and combating this phenomenon
mrs souchet has gone halfway in rejecting what the commission is trying to do but there is a very dangerous precedent being set here if the commission is allowed to get away with evading the provisions of the acquire commaunitaire and the provisions of the various fundamental treaties which set up the common fisheries policy
he said that he not only wanted crossborder zones but large areas of northwest russia to be covered
in providing and caring for the elderly that will mean utilizing new technologies and new methods of ensuring that they have independent means of living and can fully participate in their own community
if we carry on in this fashion then not only will our work continue to be undermined but so will what perhaps makes sense of the use of nuclear energy and that brings me to my cetera sense
unfortunately labours approach to this question is likely to lead to more unemployment not less
i should like to single out just three of these basic problems first the problem of access to waters which should at least be reexamine as part of the reform
on behalf of the verts a l e group f r i am speaking as chairman of the delegation for relations with the countries of the andean community
they say and we pay
it is for these reasons that we initially submitted a proposal to reject these texts thereby requiring the commission to revise its proposals this approach which was also adopted by my fellow member mr schlyter of the group of the greens european free alliance enabled our rapporteur mr fjellner to whom i pay tribute to undertake a major review of the commissions proposals
what is true is that we are paying close attention to the problems to which we need to find the right solutions
i would like to add one more thing
the question that is being asked is what can europe do for me
i have three observations to make
the crossborder healthcare issue has been under negotiation for a long time and it caused an outcry when in a previous draft the risk emerged of creating twospeed healthcare specifically promoting medical tourism for betteroff patients and charming those member states which could not have planned their healthcare provision on the basis of a demand that depended on the quality offered
a moment later he arrives at the drivers office
the eu must not be given tasks that the member states can take care of themselves and the labour market really is a matter that should fall to them
they are not political debates
mr president commissioner i would like to start what i have to say by pleading for greater seriousness and a more objective approach
as mr leinen has rightly said we are now on an equal footing with the council and therefore parliament is not in a position of inferiority
this then is the issue this and no other
even if this report seems a bit fishy to me a fish with a very spanish flavour i do welcome the fact as a number of earlier speakers have mentioned including both mr linkohr and mr voggenhuber that once again we in parliament are dealing with one of the most important commodities namely water
all technical assistance was stopped except if promoting democracy or humanitarian aid
the only criterion will be whether or not a country really has met the conditions for accession
who would not be in favour of improving peoples health and reducing costs
mr president i should like to thank commissioner van den broek for doing his best to answer our questions
also of course we must look for a continuation of the human rights dialogue
mediterranean agriculture markets are already virtually saturated in the case of some products and north african countries are starting to penetrate these markets
it is a question among other things of giving employees a say in the development of the employment pact and coordinated economic policy
i at any rate have not changed my name i am still called swoboda and i am also proud of this typical german name
with a view to befitting fully from the potential offered by cohesion policy as the rapporteur has illustrated clearly it is necessary to commit in a more determined manner to reducing the gap between the highlydeveloped eu regions and those that are less developed pursuing this goal is in my opinion possible by increasing the funds intended for cohesion policy and facilitating greater control over project approval and over methods of investment
s k the continuing turbulence on financial markets shows us that the global financial system reacts very sensitively to all information on the creditworthiness or solvency of individual players
last year the court of justice decided that the citizens of the european union have a right of access to healthcare in all member states
if a liquidity squeeze means that small and mediumsized banks are unable to make cash and its equivalent available then big problems are coming our way
there is too much suffering too much hardship and this must end this must stop now
human rights dialogues have become an increasingly important component of the eus activities to promote human rights worldwide
the commission and my colleague mr mandelson in particular is looking forward to engaging with you in open and constructive dialogue in order to reach solid and realistic conclusions aimed at strengthening the w t o and the whole multilateral trade system
i would ask the commissioner to take this a little further
based on the experience of the past twelve years the proposal reflects the commissions determination to cut red tape whilst facilitating compliance with european union legislation taking due account of the subsidiary and proportionality principles
i should like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation of the council
i think that in this situation romania is entitled to provide parliament with all the reports about its accession to the schengen area
another priority axis is environmental protection and improvement with the objective of devoting between one quarter and one third of our total loans each year to environmental projects
this double proposal clearly seeks to facilitate the implementation of amendments to conventions by the member states of the union and of course by having just one committee to improve efficiency in the implementation of safety policy
what we need the commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date
however mr president over and above these deeprooted differences lie the most deeplyrooted common principles which ultimately boil down to something as simple as the need for trust between member states
governments were not quite ready for this
in addition hamas itself has shown its ability to respect a negotiated truce for an entire year
i also wish to take this opportunity to congratulate president lugo on the results obtained in paraguay as an example of these changing trends of which we ought to take due note
some countries on the other hand require explicit consent
the same applies in fact to all those other questions and observations in the green paper that pertain to the furnishing of proof for example the hiring of experts or group activities these are all examples that fall within the scope of national civil law in respect of which the european union cannot prescribe any legislation

a key point however is that people have been singling out france and other member states that are enjoying certain successes
it seems clear that the european union is preparing to fill the holes by creating new compulsory levies
in those circumstances i would suggest that we at least make our words on the partial suspension of the t a c i s programmer under the budget year two thousand entirely compatible with what was decided in helsinki mainly and most particularly that if we are going to save the democracy budget line we should also equally save the budget line which applies to nuclear safety projects
some of the common interest projects on this line are at an advanced stage of preparation or implementation in particular the eastern highspeed train between vaires and baudrecourt and the improvement of the danube rail link between salzburg and vienna

it appears wise for shady and parasitic enterprises to maintain good relations with members of the european commission and top officials

mr president commissioner lamy and others have spoken of the seattle meeting as a failure but i still believe that if the eu and the u s in particular learn the lessons of the past few weeks the meeting in seattle could still go down in history not as a failure but as the moment when world leaders finally realized that they need a radically different approach to international trade

this is a huge legislative package which has raised our status once again for example as a legislator on the world stage and in putting us in a position to compete once more with the united states
that may often be inconvenient as indeed it was in the past
there should be no budgetary support for those countries that do not qualify on account of bad governance
the rapporteur is correct to observe that we need to proceed with structural reforms regarding social policy and the integration of labour markets and fiscal incentives to small and mediumsized enterprises the process of reducing longer deficits must be combined with other efforts stimulating the economy such as improved preconditions for investments and an improved internal market providing increased competitiveness
i would therefore once more request the commission to underline the importance of competition and to make its opinion known on the present situation where acquisitions in the retail trade clearly have been made at a price considerably higher than the market price this i believe demonstrates that it is a question of preventing competition and not of rationalization or any other radical structuring
this applies twice as much to the special reserve proposed in category one

this israeli strategy clearly aimed at causing a popular uprising against the leaders of hamas is unacceptable and can only lead to a fresh escalation of violence

that is a challenge we must take up together
since lifting the visa requirements for serbia montenegro and macedonia last december bosnia and herzegovina and albania have made significant progress as indicated in the report which therefore no longer justified their isolation and separation
the treaty is a step backwards in terms of establishing freedom of movement because it requires unanimous decisions for the next five years
it provides more clarity because various provisions regulating the same issue are often spread over different legal texts

we should not forget even if one hundred of the allowances are cautioned purely theoretically as we have just heard that is a sum of e u r two billion definitely a manageable sum for the airlines which will no doubt have an effect on the setting of prices however i do not envisage any problems with this including in connection with the large number of flights

madam president commissioner as mr moreira da silva reminds us in his report ten years have passed since the nineteen ninety two rio earth summit i hope that in september we can celebrate the implementation of the kyoto protocol
why are we having this debate
it mr president baroness ashton ladies and gentlemen in order to achieve peace all parties first need to take on some commitments beginning with the recognition of israel to all effects which is still not the case in some countries and therefore all countries in the area need to offer basic essential guarantees in order to establish relations built on mutual respect
could you explain what you said commissioner i should be delighted if you could accept these amendments too because they relate of course to the mutual compatibility of the directives
i should like to say in this regard however that leaving too much of the work to the experts instead of to politicians means that things are sometimes called inconsistencies that are not inconsistencies but instead are often what we would call political progress attributable to changes in views and to which camp is in the majority including in this house
entire countries are therefore being driven into ruin because uncontrolled financial flows cause the national budget to collapse
in particular labour m e p s welcome the emphasis in this report on the better functioning of civilian e s d p missions

there are very important reasons for this if the number of road accidents in poland is similar to that in germany it means that the situation in poland is bad
the commission therefore aims to establish lists of permitted health claims as well as to update permitted nutrition claims
measures in other words capable of promoting a common european response in order to better address the macroeconomic imbalances between member states and to ensure their sustainable growth
this is an area that i have always believed to be of major importance to the future namely making european legislative mechanisms and regulations easier to understand raising awareness of them and bringing them closer to citizens
however it does leave the member states a considerable amount of scope
a dialogue must be opened which must include the prime minister who is currently in prison and who must be released immediately

it is up to us the international community to think how to guarantee the security of both
what will the commission do to change this situation when the regulation of the solidarity fund currently says that it should help to quickly restore normal living conditions and it should act swiftly and efficiently to help as quickly as possible in mobilizing emergency services
allow me to express my sincere gratitude to rapporteurs who examined the european development fund and chairman of committee on budgetary control who have skilfully guided the entire process
only in that way is the commission able to guarantee that the community resources are used in an efficient and transparent manner
at the same time i would like to echo what was said as long ago as nineteen ninety four by emphasizing that any consideration of kaliningrads future development must start from the premise that the area will continue to belong to russia under international law and that its legal status will be determined solely by those competent to do so in moscow and in kaliningrad itself
it removes the burden of the remarked authorization procedure for bioproteins modernists the labeling of feed through proper information for the customer and places regulation at the heart of legislative procedures it improves market transparency through the notification system for new feed materials facilitates innovation and competitiveness in the eu feed business and marks a concrete step against the misleading of feed users be they farmers or pet owners

however this is precisely why we as europeans must invest more to strengthen african civil society institutions such as parliaments free media universities et so that africans themselves can demand and impose conditions such as those emerging from the m d g s and ensure that these are respected

it is a modest regulation in terms of its budget but very ambitious in terms of its objectives we all agree on the need to approve it but nevertheless we have spent a year and a half – perhaps much more – dealing with procedural and bureaucratic issues which have nothing to do with the fundamental issue which is to approve it on time and properly so that the commission may have an instrument allowing it to maintain the regulation

i must begin by complimenting mr wolf on his report and the fact that he managed to reach after much laborious effort a wording and compromises that enabled the report to be resoundingly approved in committee without giving ground on any of the principles or key ideas on employment and unemployment which underpin the social aspect

member of the commission madam president i welcome the initiative and report by mrs neyts uyttebroeck this initiative and report send a very welcome signal about the commitment of the european parliament to support the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia i c t y

the passing on of contaminated blood can and does have fatal consequences and i welcome strongly the proposals to regulate the transportation of blood and to ensure supervision by qualified staff which represent an important step forward in this directive
what has to be emphasized first in this deplorable business is that it is not luxembourgs legislation and practices that deserve to be pilloried here but the way the kralowetz affair has highlights social deficits in the european area and the european union a sphere in which such things are inexcusable
the twoyear restriction period on the labour market imposed on the new member states expires at the end of this year
in many countries the public still have very little confidence in the new currency
mr president the united nations declaration adopted in new york two days ago is an important victory for all women
they are of course the main instruments through which we grant financial support so as to speed up and support the process of economic convergence
that is the best guarantee that they will not face excessive fines
what can what must the european parliament do to force the necessary changes
we recognize that they suffered less from the crisis and in particular suffered fewer losses in terms of human resources
there are however provisions governing the transmission of documents to judicial authorities
it must become a growth fund offering member states loans that will facilitate a policy of budgetary adjustment
my second concern relates to the reaching of an agreement
two wrongs never make a right
as regards the european quality log we must also discuss and decide in this chamber which objectives we want it to achieve
it is based on the intervention criterion of article two b of the european globalisation adjustment fund e g f regulation which requires at least five hundred redundancies over a ninemonth period in enterprises operating in one region or two contiguous regions at nuts i i level
whilst to a certain extent a number of the amendments which have been proposed to the report improve the situation there are still one or two issues which need to be addressed in my opinion
the obligation to report side effects and submit periodic reports to the authorization authority ensures continuous comprehensive assessment of any given medical product there is a very effective safety net in the field of pharmacovigilance
mr president we are all aware that the european union is highly dependent on external energy sources and has very limited scope to influence energy supply conditions
pursuant to rule one thousand one hundred and twelve of the rules of procedure and at the request of several political groups i propose to include in today s agenda as the first item the report by mrs schleicher on behalf of the committee on constitutional affairs on the statute and financing of european political parties
my second question to you mr van den broek is this against the background of the dayton agreement how do you intend to respond to the obvious restrictions placed on the press in the republic of serbia
that is extortion
i agree however with what mr audy said it is also very important to move in the direction of increased supervision as we have done for a number of institutions
we try to set up the situation in the slaughterhouses so that animals suffer as little stress as possible when being slaughtered particularly in order to improve the quality of the meat and we ignore the conditions when they are being transported that is incomprehensible
mr president in many ways i find it very difficult to know what to say today because i unlike many of my colleagues am from a generation that does not have a living memory of the tragedy that was the very foundation of the european union
as rapporteur i endorse amendment eighty on the exclusion tout court of local transport tabled by my group but i have also indicated my support for amendment eighty one which gives member states the power to exempt local transport provided that they guarantee passengers a similar level of rights to that set out in the regulation
we now have a number of projects under way in the stop programme
it says that the swedish trade unions were wrong to try to force a latvian undertaking to sign their collective agreement in particular with regard to the minimum wage
it would send the wrong message to the people to say that reducing working hours is going to produce full employment
but as you know when the council finally adopts that initiative it will solve only part of the problem
europe is founded on the principles of democracy and the rule of law if we are not consistent first and foremost in the context of european union affairs employing all the means available to us including the suspension of the association agreements with countries which have blatantly violated human rights how can we be credible as promoters of these rights within the united nations
i think that it is important to promote and develop research in this area and to improve the coordination between different research projects in the individual member states in order to ensure that we have healthy bees
the rapporteur himself acknowledges that these guidelines are a repetition of previous recommendations but what is being called a new approach is only more of the same with even greater intensity when what is crucial is to find a new direction
on several occasions we have been able to express our views on repeated statements on the theme of all totalitarian regimes
this cooperation was mentioned a little earlier by mr speciale the committees excellent chairman and i feel i need to say this publicly because he enabled all of us to work towards a realistic and objective since we are speaking of objectives view of the situation
nevertheless i share the opinion that the data included in this scoreboard are still not sufficient or adequate to enable a comparison to be made between the behaviour of the various member states and the real benefits arising from state aid
however i propose that they should speed the transposition up which would include those candidates that have already started on this
that is what i criticism and for that reason i have voted to the statute question in its present form
moreover due to demographic changes there will probably be an increasing demand for doctors in europe
a lot of the criticisms from the public relate to cattle coming from outside the european union into the european union
wherein lies the problem in my view there is a leadership deficit in the european institutions when it comes to tackling these issues a deficit in the commission and in parliament
research has to be used not only to develop new weapons but also to protect ourselves from their misuse above all it must be used to dismantle the weapons upon whose reduction we have actually agreed
i obtained from voting because i cannot accept the fact that the budget for research over the next three years has not increased in real terms even though the lisbon process and the declarations of the heads of state or government rightly consider research to be a key priority for europe
during the swedish presidency we have been discussing sustainable development and giving greater priority to environmental matters and in the specific context of a motion on the energy dependence of the european union we are have been talking about reducing that level of dependence that ought to mean that when it comes to transport policy we should be taking greater account of the potential of railways
those of us who support it want it to continue to evolve and yield positive results
in the case of two building societies e b s and i n b s we are also considering the structuring of these financial institutions
this is bad news for the environment for safety for working conditions and also for animal welfare
i will also mention the cyprus issue
ladies and gentlemen in the course of our discussions we met with f i f p r o which represent the players
this as you know is a people numbering twenty five million souls whose existence is not recognised
may i assure mr maccormick and other members of this parliament that the present situation where excise taxes differ between member states is indeed something which is not conducive to the proper functioning of the internal market
as far as i am concerned the liberalization of drug use and the current suppression of drug use in my country constitute two dogmatic positions that are perfectly symmetrical
without consent there will be no financial perspective
i congratulate my fellow members mr corbett and mr méndez de vigo on their fruitful and creative contribution
that is totally ridiculous because if parliament adopts amendments to the budget it is elementary that there should be a mechanism to follow up on those amendments to know exactly what has happened
secondly we need to dare to tell the truth about what is happening to us
we therefore consider the finance initiative to be justified and so we refused to vote for the resolution of the european parliament
mr president the earth moved tragedy struck and our world changed
thirteen consumer rights
niebler report a five hundred and four million three hundred and thirty two thousand and one
thirdly the programmes in both greece and ireland are still in the relatively early stages
instead we are advocating measures to secure the only truly common policy that exists in the eu

after nineteen eighty nine the solidarity government was unconcerned by the fate of the shipyard
we know the problems there are with protection of the baltic
the final topic is the dublin regulation which was mentioned by mrs roure among others
this is a real necessity if we still believe in the prevalence of politics over a certain type of economy characterized by bobbing which has certainly not yielded the desired result thus far as is shown by the figures on the economic slowdown
even more likely to come to their aid in cases of extreme disasters such as the tsunami is the incredible generosity of the general public
are you therefore unable to accept amendments four and seven of the report
there are twenty million unemployed across the european union
my report proposes that the elected representatives should have the power to organize this assessment having joint responsibility for it together with the commission and consulting in particular the economic and social committee the committee of the regions and the various sectoral committees
one of the main tasks of european health policy should be to convey the importance of vaccination programmes for children and the importance of immunization in general and to increase the rate of participation in vaccination programmes particularly in the context of the growing demands being placed on our health budget
that is the directive that is before us this morning and on which we will be voting later on today
mr president i wish to thank everyone for this very interesting debate

at any event there will be opportunity to continue this dialogue with a number of other countries
on behalf of the verts a l e group f r mr president the human rights situation and situation of the civilian population is still critical in chad and no initiative towards political dialogue has any chance of succeeding if we do not first have a clear response concerning the fate of the members of the opposition arrested on the third of february and if there is no end to the violence that always occurs even as we speak against those whom idriss déby brutally sees as adversaries to be eliminated
such programmes should be formulated by the social partners at specific enterprise level and certainly not be a political dictate
i would also like to say that in recent weeks our strategic relationships with the united states and with the russian federation have taken great steps forward
incineration cannot be viewed as a waste management option on a par with recalling and reuse this will just attract further investment into incinerators and directly undermine the waste hierarchy
for the first time the national governments of these countries made a commitment to learn from each other and to exchange strategies on how to improve life for the roma minority in areas such as employment education housing and healthcare

on the pretext of maintaining fish stocks the aim is to end subsidies and limit funding for fleet renewal thereby accelerating the demise of small and mediumsized enterprises in countries such as greece where fisheries are traditionally of both social and economic importance
as recalled in this house in particular by mr bielan this was a deliberate act because the nineteen thirty two harvest although below average would have been sufficient to feed the entire population as proven by the fact that in that year the soviet union exported more than one million tones of grain to western europe
so would it not have been a good idea for corruption to be raised at the g eight summit the only reference that i can find and it was an oblique one was about developing countries
this along with the fact that the hitherto reluctant hungarian government has decided to support the construction of the pipeline could mean that the gas pipeline connecting european consumers with energy sources in the caspian sea region could now become the symbol of a successful common energy policy instead of being an emblem of vacillation
european agricultural policy needs to deliver environmental services then taxpayers will be prepared to pay for it
the commission is not alone in being able to ask u c l a f to carry out an investigation although it is the main institution involved in the investigations
i should like to conclude with a vote of thanks to
this is essential since s m e s form nine hundred and ninety eight of all firms and employ sixty six of the european workforce
this need appears to be met by the method of open cooperation
for the above reasons the nonattached members will be abstaining in the vote on the report as we do not consider the content of the report to be a sufficient guarantee that the interests of italian tobacco producers will be protected
the second point of the unions declaration of the twentyfourth of september with regard to which concerns are again growing is respect for human rights by the two opposing parties
many developing nations do not have the capacity at local levels to carry out major development programmes i see a real opportunity to second personnel from europe to help with this work
do we want to increase this already worrying number of people who are living on the poverty line
how can it be that he negotiated contracts to a total value of several hundred million e c u with seventeen directoratesgeneral
taking into account that in the area of satellite communication the european union at present covers forty of the world market we can clearly see that a common nondiscriminatory policy can significantly strengthen the important role of the union in this sector
as these are three areas where i believe in the unions positive action i did not hesitate to vote for this text
the trade union confederations c n t g and u s t g are now the main force in the fight for democracy

as far as we are concerned they will be
so can we please never fall into the error of identifying terrorism justified in islamic terms with islam as a whole
reference is made for example to the islamic religion having certain requirements of a legal order that would conflict with the european legal order in certain areas and european muslims are warned against islamic manipulation
i would have liked the european council to have said more about the significant disparities within the our area including the different competitive positions of member states
in the letter i sent to you in december nineteen ninety six asking for your vote i spoke of five challenges the union and therefore its parliament would have to face five major challenges to be met in two and a half years
to me it seems quite right to impose sanctions and to introduce an information requirement for employers and if an employer has exploited someone compensation should be paid even after that person has gone home

what these weapons and munitions give rise to around the world is however clear in all forms of war the facts are what they are but the most serious point is that it does not all finish with the end of the war but continues afterwards because the land is contaminated and continues to be so
ladies and gentlemen we have with us here today a delegation from moldova whom i should like to welcome
what we are doing here is extending a body of practice which will allow us to protect consumers
we accept the near inevitability and in many cases the desirability of mergers and takeovers but we also see the potential and actual dangers
the second approach involves reducing direct aid to agricultural income to eighty five of its current level the cost of enlargement would then be ten of the communitys budget
given that the main instruments of the c o m in fruit and vegetables centre on producers organizations we can only conclude as this house did at the time that what we have is only half a c o m
hence it is essential that the member states and the commission take the necessary steps to ensure that the rights of migrant workers are upheld and to improve their situation
this lobby was also represented here in parliament by the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe
and yet what europe is trying to find at the moment – in order to ensure that the rich tapestry of todays reunited europe is properly represented within all the institutions – is people who have opinions people who have visions people who can best represent the countries that nominate them
the historical roots of this concept that is to say the protection of the free mandate of members against interference from what originally were often still very much monarchyled authorities now only serve as a partial justification for the institution of immunity
i could not disagree more with mrs guinebertière
my question is why are the successors to tony blair and marek belka objecting to the charter and depriving their fellow citizens of its benefits i would also request the chairman of the council of europe to ask the present prime ministers of poland and the united kingdom why they are not honoring the signatures of their predecessors
set in counterpart to this yet an integral part of our experience is the ultimate establishment of the rule of law and human rights the freedom of individuals and nations democracy as the criterion of political power social justice and stability as the goals to which we must constantly aspire
here too the member states do not appear to be complying directly with requirements which they themselves set
this role is crucial
in any case we insist or at least we ask as we have of course already decided that the debate take place now without delay
for example many fingers are being pointed at cargo flights
a lot has however been expropriated monetary sovereignty has been expropriated and as a result of that we want to give the decision on the our back to the people because the people very often say enough of the our
for example one could not argue that taking those measures in relation to south africa during the years of apartheid was anything other than helpful largely because of the emphasis which the white community in south africa placed on sporting links
i think that would be a serious mistake as for not using the byproducts the same thing applies
full cooperation with the hague tribunal is not enough because it needs to be brought to a successful end
a few weeks ago on the twentyninth of may of this year a conference was organised in brussels by the european m s platform
madam president you did indeed deal with it very speedily but i do think that it is not acceptable that a member should rise in his place and make such a serious allegation against other members of the house
it takes a great deal of courage for someone to attack the government of venezuela from this tribune when it is clear that the reasons for the attack lie elsewhere
europes attitude to this matter is perhaps the decisive criterion in the success or failure of any attempt to relaunch the euro mediterranean partnership
animal protection is not just a principle which we can apply willynilly the authors of the treaties have imposed this on us
f r mr president as far as the group of the greens european free alliance is concerned cohesion policy is at the heart of one of the most fundamental policies of the european union solidarity
if we depart from the approach which has proved so successful and let ourselves be guided by the demands of poorly understood national interests allowing the mechanisms for solidarity to be downgraded and policies and resources to be renationalised we shall be unable to rise to these challenges
both proposals were broadly supported by parliament at first reading
mr president in his last editorial published yesterday in the sole twenty four ore professor marco biagi listed the results of the barcelona summit and called for the member states particularly italy to pay more heed to the councils demands for labour market reforms
our plea is for this regulation which is at the heart of olaf to be further developed together with the council
another objection is that the wrong parliament committee womens rights has led on this proposal
it is also a scandal that the eu budget should be used to support bullfighting which is a tradition i do not consider to be compatible with modern values and animal rights
question no forty five by anna terrón i cusí h eight thousand two hundred and ninety nine
this again underlines the need for the protocol on social policy to be incorporated in the treaty because otherwise we would be faced with the second directive on equal treatment not being transposed in the united kingdom
this is another of the great messages of tampere
the consequences of ignoring the problems now could be catastrophic furthermore we might not be able to solve them anymore in the future
amendment one was adopted by rollcall vote
this omission is the potential source of future irregularities as regards our individual and collective freedoms
the aim of this initiative is to guarantee equal treatment and legal certainty in relation to the granting of service concessions as is the case for public contracts while making a clear distinction between public contracts and concessions
we believe it to be important that that monitoring be extended to the referendum
it was criticized as duplication the american g p s but that made me think of the fable of the blind man and the paralytic
the o s c e parliamentary assembly has also addressed the question of developments in human rights and sent a delegation to turkey
divergent rules in the member states on advertising for instance will mean that internet providers in the european union are treated differently
in order to do so it needs to carry out institutional reforms where necessary and for example secure its financial resources

the excessive use of force by the governments against demonstrators has violated every single international convention on civil and political rights
finally the statement makes it clear that the european community and its member states agree on the importance of supporting the efforts of the un secretary general to bring about a comprehensive settlement of the cyprus problem in line with the relevant un security council resolutions and the very principles on which the eu is founded so that a just and lasting settlement will contribute to peace stability and harmonious relations on the island and in the region in a broader sense

however i have one question and that is are they satisfied that the reciprocity of market access which has been spoken about will establish a level playing field for the european union
thank you mr president a lot of what was said in the previous debate is of great relevance to this directive too
we have not made any real progress in legislative matters when it comes to the european minimum income for instance and thus there is still a lot of work to be done
de mr president ladies and gentlemen i find todays debate on the one hand a sobering experience but am also on the other refreshed and reinvigorated by it
this position cannot simply be changed by means of a few formalities
the union has held a very clear position on burma with the commission especially commissioner marín the council rather exceptionally and obviously our parliament all in agreement

what views does the commission have on the proliferation of so called hate websites particularly those that promote and incite hatred that is racist anti semitic and anti roma websites including websites which indicate names and contact details of activists that then may be targeted

what quality wines have in common is that the yield per hectare is low so they do offer a genuine way of controlling production
p l mr president i would like to take this opportunity to express my respect for the brave mountain people of tibet who are fighting for national independence

twenty to thirty per cent of world industrial timber production is illegal as is sixty of the harvesting that has taken place in africa over the last ten years

we hope and believe and indeed already know that there is great support for equality between men and women and for non discrimination even in other political groups
destruction of the forests should be brought to a halt
if we look ahead slightly one thing is also important the stability and growth pact must be strengthened
whichever way you look at it if we ourselves do not respect the institutions visitors will not respect them either
migration is another very important new topic on foreign policy
i would also welcome the compromise achieved in this area by parliament and the council which will enable us definitively to adopt trains european networks in the energy sector completing the entire framework
a multiplicity of related measures is required to make a real impact
it makes no sense to budget for even higher amounts if the absorption capacity remains restricted and the commission delegations are understated
it is important to remain strictly impartial and objective on this issue resisting the temptation to approach it bombastically
and what of the military s influence over the regime which is still powerful lastly does no one question the impact that the size of turkey s population will have on the social and economic cohesion of an enlarged europe
other amendments that we have tabled will i hope be adopted in plenary
mr president we have the same technical problem with the sixth indent of paragraph fifteen
your position is of course extremely understandable
this is why i consider that the instrument we provide today to the commission should be used very cautiously under very clearly limited conditions and doubled by a rigorous parliamentary control
i should just like to add a word about interinstitutional agreements in general
it must quickly become a powerful concept of respect for the most advanced rules in relation to knowledge employee rights sustainable development and environmental protection and the expression of a responsible economic attitude
i agree with the previous speaker that result orientation is a nice idea but it is possible to be much more modest and yet almost revolutionary as far as you are concerned
on behalf of the a l d e group mr president motor insurance has been a success story of this parliament and the long line of directives still actually represents some unfinished business business which sadly involves an increasing number of our citizens as they exercise their rights of free movement across the union
we do feel however that bearing in mind the objectives and its enlargement to ten more countries funding should be stepped up even further
many of these measures have already been implemented in the european union with the support of the secretary general of n a t o
only a few months ago mr mccreevy assured us that the talk about financial risks and crises was theoretical and we would never run into new bubbles

the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy unanimously supported the european commission by adopting a draft resolution rejecting the indefinite postponement of implementation and calling on the united states not to use retaliatory measures
in an attempt to avert similar threats in the future it would be right to consider implementing called stress tests of nuclear plants in eu member states
i would like to place the major road scheme which is very important in remote areas in context
mr president there is good news and there is bad news for tourism in the european union
good ideas always spread so that should not be too difficult

therefore i support the call to cancel haitis international debt
the challenges faced by the eu are exciting and historic they should inspire us all to roll up our shirt sleeves
this brings us to the points of agreement with the rapporteur
thirdly the e c b should discuss on a regular basis developments in each of the member states of the our area in order to have a positive influence on price and wage developments which must as mr duisenberg rightly pointed out differ from member state to member state

i would like to evoke simply the keywords here we all want this institution to be independent accountable and endowed with efficient organization and its work to be transparent so that it will increase citizens trust in the work of the european institutions

there has been a vast panorama of initiatives at the technical and scientific level involving european and mediterranean universities and nongovernmental and twinning organizations the presidency has also sought to reaffirm the role of the union in the search for solutions to the cyprus crisis through the nomination of its own ad hoc representative
i also expect that as a result of carrying out such an assessment the governments will be able to agree on a more appropriate site for this gas terminal than the gulf of trieste
it should be emphasized as we already have done when stating the reasons for our vote on the thomas report on the new common organization of the market for bananas that this situation has become possible only because the decisions of the world trade organization which increasingly panders to american interests are being imposed on the european union without any reaction or show of political will by the latter in defence of its producers and those in the poor a c p countries
i think that the time has arrived commissioner and madam presidentin office of the council to abandon rhetoric and to take action
the first is that europe is growing old and grey
the question is whether all of this should be included in such a constitution or if it would be possible to refer to it using different means
i should like to say to that it is important for the eu also to guarantee that the organizations working on gender equality are treated equally and are given financial aid for longer than the two years you propose a twoyear aid programmer does not provide financial security for any organization
mr patijn ladies and gentlemen because of the timetable difficulties we have had today and the work commitments mr patijn informed us of at the beginning of the session we are going to close question time to the council here but i want you to know that in future i shall make sure that any changes in timetable do not interfere with the time we devote to questions

many firms come into regions only for the temporary financial advantage mostly because of cheap labour
they would be very pleased if we would just accept these substances as unproblematic and wonderful

exercising the presidency of the union and bringing the european summits to a successful conclusion is certainly no easy task and it must have been especially difficult in the six months that have just ended
in its report the european parliament stresses that the conclusion of a free trade agreement f t a between the eu and the g c c is a priority for further cooperation with our mediterranean partners
i really do apologies for being unable for once to be present for the whole debate but i have told you the reason why and i ask for your understanding

it therefore stands to reason that we are particularly supportive of the proposal for a limit value of five micrograms per cubic metre of air
the third word is effectiveness if we continue to water down the content of our proposals we will arrive at the lowest common denominator and we know what that is
however you also know that ninety five of eu financing which the cities are asking for goes solely to road transport
s v of course it is important for the respective member states to make a list of the existing industrial land that is polluted and the best way to tackle this problem

this is moving in the right direction
my one disappointment is that the parliament was not stronger on the need to unbundle energy ownership to avoid conflicts of interest and to create a more level playing field for energy competition

the authorities in khartoum are also continuing their military offensive in southern sudan thereby causing hundreds of victims and preventing the necessary humanitarian aid from reaching the non muslim population

madam president madam commissioner ladies and gentlemen if the first triennial report on cohesion was good and the commission and particularly directorate general x v i deserve our congratulations for the analysis and thought that went into the document then the report on that document presented by our colleague juan de dios izquierdo collado is a balanced and wellstructured text containing rigorous and thorough analysis and just to read it gives an idea of the huge efforts which such an undertaking required
most people are looking forward to a good match and hope that it will be safe

this does not merit such rejoicing
i think that we might end up in a situation because i think some of the difficulties the sector has been facing are actually rooted before the cotton reform was made in two thousand and four

so important is this process that we must not allow ourselves to indulge in other bouts of institutional junkies or go off onto selfserving ego trips during this debate
there will be another commissioner because we must also be serious about this we must also see that there are problems to do with insecurity in europe and that there are things that we can do together with the added value of europe who will also look at other issues but always with the same spirit the spirit of security with full respect shown for individual freedoms and with full respect shown for fundamental rights

consolidation of the internal market could also be hampered if court decisions in different member states result in a situation where different interpretations are given on how similar competition problems need to be addressed

a study of the broader situation reveals that unemployment in this sector has affected a couple of states in the european union in particular it also reveals that those same states are refusing to recognize the free market within the european union

mr president i shall make no remarks about football
we do not want technically different charging systems across europe the idea of twenty seven different systems in future is unacceptable
and i insist what kind of assistance can we give
they must not degenerate into empty shells which passively observe market developments
the commission is aware of its duty to ensure the continuity of the institutional work of politics we have done so throughout recent years consistently loyally and with dedication and indeed this very evening i am going to dublin for talks with the irish prime minister precisely to ensure this continuity and so that the work we are doing is not fragmented by the continual changes that take place
the european unions activity must focus more on creating the conditions that will give these enterprises a better chance
in this spirit i believe that unlawful prisoner transfers and the hypothesis that more or less secret places of detention exist if such events were to be demonstrated in the appropriate manner would undoubtedly constitute a serious violation of international law and fundamental human rights
i would conclude by insisting also on the need to close the severe gaps in agricultural statistics
it also turned out the pilot was flying with american ordnance survey maps which do not even show the ski lift instead of using italian ordnance survey maps which do show it
i am not surprised the commission is having trouble producing a basic document for discussion on sustainable and social development
p t mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i should like to begin by agreeing with mr díaz de mera and mr castiglione both from my group in their praise for the rapporteur mr deprez who has provided us with a characteristically excellent report
do you agree with us here that what goes around comes around and that the northerly countries are now being forced to show solidarity
has europe been absent as some people allege my answer is no although we need to make a certain distinction here
but the government has not yet been formed so for the moment it is too early to make definitive judgments
european environmental economic accounts
it is true that our state aid control system is unique in the world
the community initiative now is expiring and therefore funds must be made available in the new community initiative equal specifically for promoting women
we welcome the fact that in november the council gave serious consideration to this issue of coffee dependency
however when we speak about reform and change we are speaking about reforming our economy and making it more competitive
it is also important to organize a world conference on the issue in order to reach a common position condemning closing of human beings
we can accept forty six amendments amendments nos one three four seven to nine thirteen eighteen nineteen twenty two to twenty six twenty nine thirty thirty eight thirty nine forty one forty three forty four to fifty six fifty eight to sixty one sixty three sixty four sixty six to seventy two and seventy five but we may have to redraft some of them to ensure the overall coherence of the text
in the meantime we should be very grateful if they would wear the appropriate labels so we would know whether they support mr l e pen or mr mégret
let me make only a few more specific points
amendments nos three and four were tabled for this reason
this means a complete withdrawal from the occupied territories dismantling the settlements and allowing refugees to return home
the main thrusts of the kyoto protocol namely convergence and contraction show that our development and economic models need to change radically and to be geared towards a fairer more rational way of managing resources
and it is against this rather broader backdrop that i wish to consider the proposals in the european parliaments four reports
as regards the dutroux affair which has engendered a general climate far more dominated by emotion and vengeful passion than by reason i would like to recall that it is duty of the courts alone empowered to do so by delegation of the people to establish the responsibilities and if necessary the appropriate penalties
we have made clear our view that further reforms are necessary in such areas as human rights freedom of expression and democratic freedoms and we will continue to do so
can we please marry these two concepts
we have to go on fighting against that by raising it in every dialogue
we do not have the right to remain silent and we cannot say in the future that we did not know what was happening
the women of afghanistan have been robbed of their voice
i should like to know mr presidentin office if you are clear about the preconditions for enlargement
i agree with this amendment to the mandate of the european network and information security agency e n i s a
once in every five years this parliament is the unions personnel officer
it has not been a wholly easy experience but i think that people are broadly of the view that the consolidation of regulatory authorities within the united kingdom has been a success
i wish to thank the european parliament and mr chountis in particular for the good and balanced report on albania
many here will be astonished to learn that in the twin areas of culture and education we might even have a few things to learn from the eastern european candidate states

the rules of an unaccountable free market vote for death when this costs less than life
it was specifically about the amount of the possible e i b loan
they have made a constructive contribution to it
this means that we must act and that we must act now because the effects will not perhaps become apparent for fifty or even a hundred years
i support paragraph twenty one of the report which calls on the eu to implement the nabucco project fully and as quickly as possible
what are we expecting
we therefore hope that the european constitution will be adopted as soon as possible
the dual legitimacy of the european union by its european but also its national citizens by its peoples but also its states makes the european union institutionally complex by its very nature
it does not matter to me how the universe was created or in what time frame what is important to me is that there is a god and that we are stewards who must as amendment twenty two puts it safeguard creation
we will not respect the national declarations
social problems and climate change must not in this regard be allowed to distract attention from the main goals
even in the trialogue negotiations we included a reference to the european semester so that parliament could be duly informed of these developments
so we have to be realistic and sensible in what we hope ultimately to achieve
the study we presented recently with mr virrankoski on the implementation of the structural funds highlights the considerable time it has taken the commission to approve the national frameworks and operational programmes so there are now record outstanding commitments of three years by taking this firm stance on the reserve we wanted to raise the alarm
i would also just like to ask him about countries and governments that do not implement the floods directive
thirdly the holodomor is just one of the crimes of communism communism whose crimes inevitably must still be heard at a second nuremberg
you will tell me that we are in twenty ten now in particular the council invited the commission to consider preventive measures measures for introducing separate collection of biodegradable waste a quality assurance system based on the principle of integrated chain management and traceability throughout the process and the establishment of requirements on labeling and on quality criteria for compost and digestive
diversification of energy supply is therefore essential and it is vital to find european solutions in the supply sphere

eight countries have now succeeded in adopting legislation denmark spain ireland italy austria finland sweden and the united kingdom
what is more we have not included weight and we have not completed weight segmentation which is important for european competitiveness because it is the higherweight vehicles that are at the forefront of innovation the innovation that europe needs
mr wynn i can assure you that you will receive an answer very soon
the final selection will be presented for consultation to the other institutions including parliament and stakeholders
looking at the content of the mandates and of the p n r agreement the council is aware that the most important thing with regard to the three agreements is ensuring a sufficiently high level of data protection
it is very unfortunate that so few of our european leaders attended the world food summit five years later in rome three weeks ago
so far there has been partial success in managing to coordinate indirect taxes setting a minimal level for alcohol alcoholic beverages tobacco and fuel
it is worth considering whether the final outcome might be that a large railway monopoly in one of the member states might not be replaced or extended to become a monopoly by that same company but covering the territory of several member states
we have a responsibility for ensuring that we assess fairly and objectively whether these countries are ready in this respect to accede to the union in two thousand and seven
what is more the debate on this draft is taking place within a temporary parliamentary committee which was appointed to undermine the existing committee on budgets and spread the responsibility for whichever solution was adopted
i have to point out though that the balance of trade with the european union still always shows a considerable deficit for mexico
it manifests itself in the form of sexual exploitation as previous speakers have mentioned as well as abusive working conditions forced domestic labour illegal adoption forced begging and the sale of organs
it is in this exceptionally complex context that you have had to lead the european parliament and to represent it before our member states and before the world
and the paradox of this situation is due to the fact that we are now saying yes to a failure so as to avoid saying no to europe
however the last six months have been tragic for the people i represent
however i will study your proposals very carefully before putting a final package before the college next week for adoption
having said which i think that thanks to certain amendments approved by the rapporteur and despite certain other amendments dictated by the policy of expediency the final report which has taken shape is generally acceptable even to the official turkish side
it is certainly true and this is how i had actually planned to begin that iran has a new president for whom on the basis of his statements and attitudes i certainly have a high regard even if i do not agree with him on every detail
my opinion on antipersonnel mines is that their manufacture should be halted worldwide in other words there is no problem in this respect
what is the future for the kyoto protocol
having said that following your request i suggest that we put to the house the sense of the proposal which i have just made
if you do not want to extend the derogation if we cannot resolve this now then we will as far as the three new countries are concerned exist in a very uncertain legal framework which cannot be in the interests of those involved
fifteen is also unacceptable and in my opinion a deduction of ten at source is a maximum
thank you for your commitment and congratulations on the success you have achieved in making us more open
i believe that we must make a huge effort regarding this aspect because the fulfillment of this goal hinges on education information campaigns and a more systematic approach
planned forestry is also identified as a sustainable enterprise giving both an economic return to farmers and employment opportunities to rural dwellers
mr president ladies and gentlemen mr commissioner we do not need to persuade each other here today that the european form of company partnership offers an excellent opportunity to promote crossborder trading in europe thus it ultimately benefits employment
this battle must be fought on all levels we need laws which protect women and punish the perpetrators whether they are husbands pimps or rapists
thirdly to complete the work of the convention on the future of europe
it is quite clear that a large share has been allocated to all renewable energy sources
only the lower saxons are of course very backward here
the procedures proposed by the committee of wise men for decisions at what are referred to as level one and level two are not actually new
lastly everyone would agree that we need to amend the regulation on the financial instrument for fisheries guidance under the c f s p in to order make aquaculture eligible for subsidies for young peoples startups for small and mediumsized businesses for promoting the quality of fishery products for promotional campaigns for their consumption for establishing environmentfriendly practices et et this then is my appeal to the commission in the person of commissioner solbes mira and i am sorry that commissioner franz fischler is not here please do not allow this matter to fall into oblivion and please adopt effective measures to promote the aquaculture sector even more and with an eye to the future
this proposal for a framework decision however as mr oostlander quite rightly pointed out proposes nothing new and nor does it strengthen the mechanisms for combating international drug trafficking
we suggest that we make provision for new posts in certain areas but only where absolutely necessary
for this reason we have voted in favour of the brok report
although from twenty million fifty two thousand and nine in the eu tests for monitoring the residues of antibacterial agents in animals and animal foodstuffs show positive results we can still say that there is no controlled trend towards reduction only fragmented fluctuations
i also wish my negative vote to underline this scandalous situation
i also urge the commission to look at ways to ensure that channels like euronews and arte flourish and develop
the report we are voting on today is ambitious it is just as ambitious as the founding fathers of the european union were when they reached the conclusion that there was no other solution but to unite the peoples of europe if they wanted to stop them waging war on each other
however our current assessment is that most of the fifty zero refugees intend to return to their place of origin madura where they have families who will be able to support them
in these difficult economic times we cannot afford to overlook the potential of this agreement for our two regions in terms of jobs and growth
as you know to us christian democrats civil society is not just a hollow phrase
the truth is that the commission could have reacted
he has established the european monetary institute as required by the maastricht treaty
my conclusion overall is not about the value of the proposal because in a few months we will have the alternative proposal which will effectively make this one outdated and we could almost have waited for that my appeal to the commissioner is that the commission does need to look at its impact assessment and its homework on regulation proposals much more deeply and get member states to engage with them before coming up with these proposals
the council wanted to take a different approach which i find regrettable
i hope that we in the european union will be able to make our contribution to those efforts
there are however a number of issues that must be given particular consideration as they reveal the unique nature of the european security strategy
our task as administrators is to establish strict clearcut rules the same for all the community countries to prevent this phenomenon from becoming a truly dangerous one
in addition the drastic cuts in expenditure on structural funding are certainly not helping to build a europe of solidarity
with what objectives and how is the temptation to use them for other purposes avoided
this must be a flexible financial mechanism to help release funds in the shortest time possible supported by a medium and longer strategy and action plans which take account of the varied impact of climate change on the eus regions
i therefore propose producing a simplified report so that we can vote on urgent procedure
similarly the calls to boycott our products from spanish farmers across the pyrenees to respond to the attacks by french farmers are no more excusable
above all they also need to be more involved in the drawing of development strategies and in the planning and performance of activities to be carried out in this field
in a few days time it will be the anniversary of the assassination of commander massoud who was murdered a few hours before the tragedy of the eleventh of september
so i hope that it will be possible to give reassurance in that way
however i would particularly like to remind you that the prince programmer was initiated by parliament through budgetary intervention in nineteen ninety six with the clear aim of financing information campaigns on priority issues for the eu
on this occasion using the d hondt system would have penalized the smaller groups and i wanted to avoid that
however in practice this uncertainty continues given that this directive is in conflict with the principles of the convention on the granting of european patents expanding the scope of patents beyond currently established limits
it is therefore very appropriate that sustainable development should have been given such a prominent place
for instance through the e d f and the budget line for south africa the capacities of national parliaments of some eleven a c p countries have been strengthened to a total amount of thirty five million since two thousand
all in all i welcome the fact that it has been possible on account of this reduction in expenditure to increase funds in the external action sector
el madam president perhaps the overlap between the competences of the national competition authorities and the competences of other regulatory authorities is leading to the fragmentation of competition policy in numerous member states is it perhaps a source of insecurity of law
the third point concerns validation of acquired experience which really enables employees to progress their careers and also enables companies to adapt effectively to new requirements

every human being whether muslim jew christian or of no particular faith has the same value and the same right to live in dignity

if our experience since nineteen ninety four can show us anything it is that first of all we must ensure that all social policy is predicted on the basis of delivering results for people not just merely massaging figures but actually making peoples lives better
the resolution in this form diverse somewhat from polands views
it must be a mandate for a constitutional treaty a document that will create the basis for this enlarged union
violation of human rights continues and belgrade maintains that the status of kosovo is a purely internal matter in a similar manner belgrade rejects the european unions request that it also establish a presence in kosovo
to do more and faster mr reinfeldt mr barroso that is also what the p p e group expects of you where the fight against global warming is concerned

with regard to these statements will the council say whether the treaties stipulate that the eu should develop a common defence

i believe that within a functioning european union internal market we need to have close cooperation on immigration and of course on the rights of thirdcountry nationals who are longer residents
almost six years have had to go by before we have been able to get such important legislation affecting our health adopted
i apologies for not having addressed the substance but it is the process which concerns me most
we are also throwing lots of ingredients and finesounding commitments and recommendations into the pot but we are not at all sure that they will go well together
and i would remind you that the time for transactions pacts and compromises is at the end that is at the end of the convention
it contains many innovations for better managing the funds that are going to be invested in the trains european transport networks such as multiannual programming which is necessary and which is attached to each project automatic commitment so that the funds do not remain unused indefinitely the increase in rates of intervention the establishment of european coordinators or the new loan guarantee instrument
but the high profile of education in the political arena makes universities and other institutions especially vulnerable to external pressure
i will not detain you much longer ladies and gentlemen
it is becoming clear that the eu must reflect on the trade policies which it wishes to adopt when reviewing its trade strategy
the steps taken to relieve the burden of debt are also of vital importance it will however take years to rebuild the economies of these countries which were in any case desperately poor
i wonder however whether perhaps it would have been wiser for the eu to solve its internal problems before enlargement
the belgian presidency must enable decisive progress to be made in implementing the europe twenty twenty strategy
all necessary measures must therefore be taken to eliminate these adverse effects and to harmonize the cohesion policies with the goal of environmental conservation we have to find the golden mean via which the cohesion policies can in themselves contribute to the fostering of sustainability
that is what they are there for and the citizen is entitled to expect good services
mr skinner we will consider that at the appropriate time and you can declare your opposition then
in my view that is what we should be supporting and affirming and what should once again become a plan for the very life of the european union
therefore we do not accept amendments nos thirteen and twenty
to this end i would like to recommend that the member states firstly negotiate with central america
n l madam president commissioner mrs járóka i very much appreciate your report you have worked very hard on it and you have also taken us on a number of visits to the area in hungary where you come from

biogas is a very important source of renewable energy
let us not forget that these parties are the cornerstone of european democracy and there must be no doubts as to whether they are being funded in the correct manner
this is a figure that should be manageable for the twenty seven
to us this is an extremely important point by definition a safe third country opiates casebycase assessment in that we delegate our responsibility to another country that is considered safe according to rather flexible criteria asylum is not a concession it is moral and political duty and a right for men and women who are being persecuted or are fleeing from wars
however when illegal organs transplants are practised safety is often ignored and the lives of both donor and recipient are put at risk
my europe – the europe i want to be part of – is big enough to do both these things
the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe finds this regrettable and would very much like to see resolutions on those very countries – iran and china – because they are the worst offenders when it comes to the infringement of human rights
illegal shipowners exploit underpaid crews and sell fishery products at very low prices their failure to comply with the law of the sea the international labour organisation conventions and the i u u regulation of the first of january twenty ten means that european shipowners are now uncompetitive due to the labour costs they have to bear
i hope that can take place as soon as possible and i can assure you that the commission will continue to press for that to happen
it mr president ladies and gentlemen i think this house did a remarkable job of work in approving mr favas report

to reply specifically to mr schulzs question i would say as i have already done to mr orban that my idea is for the commissioner appointed by romania to assume responsibility not only for multilingualism but also for interculturalism in europe so supplementing the work done under my direction by the bureau of european policy advisers b e p a which organisms meetings on this subject
that is why the c o m must be remodeled
second we urgently need to find a way to a unified and strategic relationship with turkey of which there has hardly been any mention today

for this reason regardless of the legal ruling under which it was carried out or whether or not it was carried out within the framework of delegated acts the commission and the council must act in this matter in order to find a reasonable objective solution this will also lead to us interfering less in executive matters and therefore where everything runs properly will give the executive body greater freedom
has the council carried out any analyses
competence means power and the creation of an area of freedom security and justice is paving the way for an appalling form of centrist eu control
but i also endorse our other criticisms
i agree with the rapporteur that the joint undertaking is still in a startups period and therefore understand the relatively low utilization rate for payment appropriations
unfortunately however amendments by the conservative forces which contradict the original text have altered it it welcomes new counterinsurgency policy adopts president obamas timetable calls for closer identification by the eu with n a t o and the u s a and recognizes the efficacy of and need for troops to remain and secure the area
all of these measures are consistent with the commissions support for the eus stated position which firmly supports the territorial integrity of indonesia while encouraging the government to make urgent efforts to address and resolve peacefully indonesias internal conflicts whether separatist or sectarian in character
however the measures proposed in the common position are resided
policies affecting the internal market competition trade and research and development among others all concern the cultural sector in various ways and the proposals found in the report recognize this
however even within closer cooperation it is clear that the application of the principle of the majority in place of unanimity could create unbearable tension conferring a monopoly of decision making on one dominant country
that is why church services are public and accessible to everyone
i have the following reasons for this decision
i should also like to thank the committee on transport and tourism and specifically the rapporteur mr gonzález triviño for an excellent report on deniedboarding compensation
at the same time it clearly underlines the need to give greater momentum to dialogue
in december two thousand and four the commission – and more specifically commissioner potocnik – together with euratex that is to say the european apparel and textile organisation announced an initiative known as the textile technology one of whose purposes is to encourage technological innovation and so promote more market products in the face of chinese competition
the european parliament is being asked to draft a report on the matter fast as the e i b is ready to lend e u r one hundred and eighty million this year already
nevertheless this report manages to steer this criticism and these demands in a positive forwardlooking direction enabling the committee on agriculture to change its initial no vote into a yes vote for the tsatsosméndez de vigo report which genuinely serves to mitigate the inadequacies of the amsterdam treaty
fi madam president i will speak about mr vatanens report and i would first of all like to thank him for the open way in which he prepared it
i am genuinely happy to see such wonderful harmony within this chamber on a ninth of may this is a good sign a sign that europe is moving forward and realizes that we have a common history and a common future
therefore the report calls on the commission to present as soon as possible a detailed communication on rights linking the issue with eu development policy
evalution is naturally the key tool in improved effectiveness if the aims and objectives of projects are clear they can be assessed meaningfully
thank you for this promptness
while on the one hand it seems to me that overinvolvement of the european union in cultural activity in the member states is not necessary i think on the other that in view of what is happening today in tunisia but also in view of the events of two months ago in belarus it is important that the european union with its cultural message and its message about democracy and the rule of law addresses itself to the young elite of neighboring countries and that money is found for youth exchanges joint courses of study travel the establishment of universities and support for teaching programmes
it is true that the european council will focus on the lisbon strategy and on the stability pact
i agree with the commissioner and think she is right to reject the criticism that was made of her and should continue to do so
in the long run it will not matter whether the symbols of parliament and of the european union are debated now or at some later date
there are therefore great hopes in this summit and above all the european union has an enormous responsibility
on behalf of the u e n group it mr president having consulted many of my fellow members i would ask you for an amendment to the agenda just as you have said specifically i would ask if the battisti affair can be included as an urgent matter

the current u nauthorised eu mission in chad in which ireland is playing a leading role is a prime example of the eus activities in this area
we cannot have more europe with a meagre budget that is clearly inadequate
we lay down sureties for this these must however be both secure and flexible
it is true that there has been a lot of criticism of humanitarian aid
i believe that is the right way forward
in september two thousand and two i was informed that a revision would be carried out
it speaks volumes when we read as we currently do of a fall in the per capita average gross domestic product in germany and of germany being fourth from the bottom
what should it be levied on how high should the percentage be who levies it and who receives the money
the european union staff who were controlling the border between gaza and egypt have also had security problems
i am therefore very pleased with this report because it helps knock many of these myths on the head
if the same yardsticks are applied to all these borrowers the system of evaluation will become more expensive or the banks will be hindered from giving credit
i voted in favour of the lyon report on the future of the cap and in particular for retaining the two pillars todays vote in plenary on the lyon report is very important and symbolic since the m e p s are the first to take up a position and present their proposal for the cap after twenty thirteen

overall i believe that the french presidency has taken europe forward and that is what it was all about
we have also offered solutions to a number of practical things like iter institutions like the financial supervisory authorities and the external action service we have been constructive
this would be a disaster

madam president ladies and gentlemen what can we hope for at the outset of the dutch presidency

it also obliged us to secure our foreign and security policy more effectively so i turn now to foreign policy considerations
de madam president in austria we have thank goodness not been subjected to terrorist attacks for many years however vienna has not always escaped unscathed
the figure of two hundred million will then probably be discussed elsewhere
the wiebenga report has undoubtedly shown that we need solutions
while i am on this subject the point has to be made that it was the european parliament that said from the very outset of the negotiations following the heads of state or adoption in nineteen ninety nine of agenda two thousand that category i v was chronically underhanded in the same way that foreign and security policy and the neighbourhood policy were likely to be chronically underhanded if the luxembourg compromise for the new financial perspective were adopted
the fundamental goal of the structuring of the postal sector is to better meet interests by giving inhabitants of the european union the opportunity to receive a universal service
so reuse is not necessarily the best solution it needs to be considered with a critical eye

the response to this technological challenge does credit to our engineers
otherwise eu enlargement may become more and more like a potemkin village in which the applicants implement cosmetic changes in order to comply with the eu s demands issued from behind a deceptive façade one which even smacks of sanctimoniousness

for instance in my country lithuania maternity leave plus parental leave last up to two years but other member states have a minimum amount of maternity leave therefore i believe that the threshold we set yesterday is a very important achievement
the european union deserves fulsome tribute and credit for its longstanding interest in issues of development related to africa
es mr president over twenty five years spain has held the presidencyin office of the european union four times and as on the last three occasions it did so this time with intensely pro european dedication and responsibility
from the outset both during the period when that legislation was going through the united states congress and since then the european union has expressed strong and determined opposition to this legislation as have countries as close to the united states as canada and mexico and indeed the organization of american states
both european society and above all our deepseated convictions demand it
it is also consistent to support the proposition that enlargement will be an alternative instead of complementary and interdependence to other existing programmes such as those proposed for the mediterranean or a c p countries
we keep trying to persuade the dog to go hunting
however the problem is that just as in the case of zimbabwe certain european states follow their own agenda for the sake of commercial or other interests and in so doing run counter to the european strategy towards togo
madam president mr presidentin office of the council ladies and gentlemen i have heard the presidency being very quick to talk of a laeken declaration but feel obliged to remind them that the treaty of nice no longer exists since it was rejected by an impeccably democratic referendum in ireland

we agree that there are important barriers to integration of retail financial services markets

it would therefore be useful in addition to sending a representative to the council meetings if the council could send us a written report on which parts of our opinions it is prepared to accept and which not
the european agricultural fund for rural development needs to be coordinated with cohesion policy funds so as to raise efficiency and maximize results
although the council recognizes that the european union and the united states do not see eye to eye concerning the kyoto protocol and the ratification thereof despite this the council welcomes the pledge made by president bush during a recent meeting with the eu heads of state and government leaders that the united states will not block the kyoto process and will cooperate during the forthcoming session of the conference of the parties in bonn in a constructive manner
in our resolution we have raised just a few issues

they are plundering its economic resources for their own benefit and they are not granting their citizens fundamental rights
it is unfortunate that in the framework of the tens the commission is outing for the same approach as the white paper lots of trains not much water
de if i remember rightly i have already explained in the debate on the subject the importance of transatlantic dialogue and what the european union and also the council presidency have contributed to that debate
the progress that a country makes towards meeting such targets is the basis on which the european commission disbursed variable branches of budget support
however the tasks that await the austrian presidency are so ambitious as the president himself said that naturally there will be a tremendous amount of work to do
it is in our interest to reverse this trend an increase in private investment is necessary for growth and employment
finally i fail to understand why even the internal newsletter commission en direct should appear almost exclusively in english
so i believe parliament will do everything it can to achieve this measure
i fervently hope that i am wrong and that it will be possible tomorrow during the big antiracism conference organized by the dutch presidency for minister dijkstal to announce formally the creation of the observatory the aim is to coordinate existing organizations and stop work being done twice over

whoever you speak to in turkey even in the field of human rights even with the representatives of the kurds you will hear the message loud and clear relations between turkey and europe are improving this is our opportunity to be able to take more action this is our chance to be able to do more to bring about the appropriate changes in turkey
i take the view that this report says yes but quite rightly requires firms participating in the safe harbor to agree to pay compensation in the case of individuals suffering damage from abuse of data held on them
this is something we must do in order to help member states to address emerging economic problems at a much earlier stage
only the national liberation forces rejected this deal and this group has been linked to the death of the irish archbishop michael courtney who was the vaticans envoy to burundi
furthermore we are concerned that its adoption would lead to a conciliation process
i consider the seventy zero additional tones allocated to azorean farmers insufficient and i disagree with the transitional nature of the measure in force only until two thousand and three in clear contradiction to article two thousand nine hundred and ninety two of the treaty on european union
but we also know that the rewards make the effort worthwhile
my last point is that on consumer information the area where industry complained bitterly about offices being set up in each member state we think we have found an appropriate amendment which suggests exactly the right level of information which the consumer needs state by state
in northern europe there are people who are concerned that the loop current off the coast of florida will carry the oil on via the gulf stream to our part of the world

when you were in power wheelerdealing and selling off national assets became models of rule
p t madam president i would like to begin by praising the work carried out by the rapporteur my colleague mr stavrakakis who has done an extraordinary job of identifying future synergies between the different structural funds to increase their effectiveness his report is also involved in this joint debate on cohesion policy which is of the utmost importance not only in terms of the issue at stake but especially because the timing of the debate is opportune
these stipulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular preciselydefined cases ie those involving aid for research and development aid for environmental protection social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid to help noncompetitive enterprises cease trading altogether
the women and girls of afghanistan have had to withstand twenty years of war and constant infringement of their human rights but that does not mean they were condemned to silence

a healthy competition involving all participants of the industry should be developed where the actual competition is between individual and public transportation rather than between the different modes of public transport
i suppose the fact that the opinions of these committees are sought is some consolation but in a general way this decision needs some sort of explanation
all sorts of inferences like these have been doing the rounds lately i do not believe they have any substance
as a result of these policies we can expect a gradual decrease in oil consumption in the eu over the coming years
i will no longer vote for the european union to maintain and wherever possible to increase the levels of aid given to a c p countries

the vote on the morgan vidal quadras and chichester reports will take place tomorrow
the main concern for governments and the community is to strike a balance between promoting corporate innovation and growth on the one hand and preparing people for change and possibly the necessary protective measures on the other

i draw your attention particularly to the items where we reached agreement on the financing of universal service the study concerning the setting of a european regulatory authority an agreement about the settlement of crossborder disputes the issue of number portability for subscribers the question of transparency the basis of costs of interconnection and assistance for new providers seeking to enter the market
providing the participants with economic facilities and at the same time amplifying the process for being awarded grants brought us closer to the objectives set in the lisbon strategy
members of parliament i leave the decision to you
independent repairers could be foreclosed from the market as a result this is clearly something which could not be accepted
i must also applaud the fact that the council has already stated its position on this matter i believe that the commission has done so too
as we know this report on the exceptional trade preferences conceded to pakistan originated with a european council decision which mandated the commission to make a proposal to parliament and to the council
we must react as soon as we can measure the fact that a pesticide or its breakdown product has penetrated the root zone of the crust
in particular the report mentions the difference between the situation of a number of large member states and that of smaller ones but ultimately it is more complicated than that since we can also observe spectacular differences in results among the large member states

firstly on the subject of the urban programmer and the maximum threshold of fifty towns which a number of you termed arbitrary
the moral imperative consists in the fact that the holocaust has become a universal example of the flouting of human dignity and human rights

madam president commissioner mr presidentin office for us the agenda is a package
the commission has our full support on this

thus we need to establish a coherent european tourism policy which adds value above and beyond member state level and against which we can judge and monitor the very considerable sums of money which are spent through other eu funds most notably the structural and cohesion funds
as a result there is no new shopping and the economy and the prosperity of consumers relying on it do not grow as much as they could
progress has been very uneven in this regard
i think this could be seen as a condition for proceeding with negotiations as for myself i could feel comfortable with turkish accession when it is as easy to build a christian church in ankara as it is to erect a mosque in brussels
i will involve parliament and i also insist that parliament declare itself competent whenever youth policy is discussed whether in areas for which i am responsible or in areas which are the responsibility of other commissioners
does culture mean everything that surrounds a person and his or her entire way of life or only cultural products such as paintings sculpture architecture music and above all films which have already been mentioned today
the nineteen ninety seven annual report on the state of the drugs problem in the european union published by the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction points out that the upward trend in the number of drugrelated deaths has continued in ireland
i believe mr rothley and the committee on legal affairs as a whole have devoted a lot of time and energy to it too much in my view since i have the impression that as with the statute for european political parties it is really about money
i hope that i as rapporteur will be able to produce as good a report on the vat carrousels as my report on cigarette fraud
i would also like to say that in relation to the new structures announced and the additional measures to continue the important initiatives devised in europe over recent months we have not seen much actually happening
even here in europe c f c s have not been entirely abandoned in existing installations for instance condenser plant
nevertheless ninety of those in the west bank are peasants the felaheen they depend on agricultural exports
the murder of hundreds of women mostly workers in the north of the country is making headlines and has spanned the term feminicide
mr president over recent years the european parliament has established a record on human rights throughout the world of which we can be very proud it is therefore highly appropriate that we should put forward our priorities for the forthcoming fiftyfifth session of the united nations commission on human rights
the initiative from the committee on womens rights exceeded the required number three hundred and fourteen today we have three hundred and twenty three votes
energy security nabucco and desertec debate
mr president i should like to begin by thanking parliament for taking the initiative of holding this debate
it is based on three dimensions of the overall approach to immigration the first is better organization of legal immigration in particular this involves taking more account of the needs and reception capacities of the member states but also encouraging integration
we need the information concerned and relations between the european union and the united states should be such that in the forthcoming meetings between the two countries it should be possible to address the issues very clearly above all with a view to confronting the danger that some of you have described i can do no more than say how absolutely right it is to address these issues openly
this would be a very good example to the member states both to people working in the public and in the private sectors
more generally the new legislation will consolidate the international role and will increase its role in key sectors such as market surveillance pharmacovigilance and public awareness of medicinal products this development is also to be welcomed
the system generally applied is the one governed by the polluter pays principle a principle which is outstanding in terms of its inefficiency

although research of this kind falls within the remit of the european defence agency those working in the field of civil security research maintain close contacts with the latter in order to address the dualism aspects of security technologies
madam president the finnish presidency of the council has a very great responsibility

firstly because it covers species which have abundant stocks in mozambique shrimp and tuna
it could have come from my own lips and i can only congratulate him on it
unlike mr poos i do not see mr schröder as my spokesman
subject compliance with community policies and access to information held by the european investment bank e i b in march nineteen ninety eight the european investment bank granted a loan of about i t l sixty billion to gardaland spa for the purpose of enlarging the leisure park of the same name
this reduction is bound to cause at least a certain amount of fear and suspicion
the harmonization of air navigation systems and the control of traffic flows will contribute to this
they are equal in terms of dignity but they are different
in the past food was produced and consumed locally
whatever happened to equality between the member states of the european union
nevertheless for the time being it is better to see the whole picture before we start discussing small details
commissioner the truth is that the committee on the environment public health and consumer protection whose rapporteur it is my honour to be is not insensitive to that concern
i believe though that my government did its sums well and applied to parliament for aid on that basis
i hope that i can have an assurance that the revised document will be made available in time for parliament to consider it and to express any views before the next meeting of the judicial and home affairs council
the bill reinforces the excessively severe provisions already in place
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen for the information of the house mr president i should like to make a clarification
there are only three ways of limiting the consequences
should we like the elles report blame only the commissions inertia
with a view to further requests by other countries that want to have similar agreements we should ensure that every time we reach an agreement special standards apply
such provisions already exist or in the case of low cost housing are about to be completed in france but we believe that we need to go even further we need to go further in lowering rates and further in coordination with our european partners
in writing once again the e p reiterates its longstanding opposition to the death penalty in all cases and under all circumstances and emphasises once again that abolition of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights
i should therefore like to show my support for this proposal as tabled and also congratulate the two rapporteurs
such an approach would send out a clear signal that mutual solidarity between eu member states and towards third countries has been thin on the ground since the accession of the new member states
that might well not always be the case but we feel that competition as such is a good thing and we would like that to apply to more destinations than at the moment
hence our request to you to ask the president of the parliament in a letter or message to discuss this peace proposal as a matter of urgency
the main aim of todays report is in fact to investigate how we can help national pension systems achieve the three basic objectives of retaining their capacity to achieve the social objectives which they have set staying financially viable in the long term and responding to societys changing needs
the second aspect which i would like to underline is that the multilateral approach is not a substitute for some of the bilateral approaches
in writing ro economic immigration is a reality on which we must impose order but it is also a necessity in view of the demographic and economic challenges which the eu will face in the near future immigration policy can be regarded as an instrument for regulating our labour needs thereby helping to implement the europe twenty twenty strategy
as i made clear a rotating presidency is part of an ongoing european process it does not constitute an entirely new start
draftsman of the opinion of the committee on the environment public health and food safety mr president many congratulations to the rapporteur for her excellent work the proper management of deeper fish stocks is essential in order to promote the sustainability of the use of the seas and safeguard the conservation of marine ecosystems
this does not mean that what we are proposing is drastic and immediate action
we in the european parliament are understandably dissatisfied with the lack of parliamentary involvement in some areas
reducing the g w p threshold in mobile air conditioning will effectively mean that the development of c o two technology is the only option for european car manufacturers at the present time
however the radical political and more importantly economic reforms on which so many latin american countries embarked at the end of the nineteen eighties must be pursued to their end
a heady climate of permissiveness has been created in the wake of the abolition of internal borders and the gradual liberalisation of trade which has in turn led to a lack of investment in essential technical resources such as reference laboratories and research centres and human resources such as professional training
the next item is the recommendation for second reading a four million twenty one thousand seven hundred and ninety six from the committee on economic and monetary affairs and industrial policy on the common position established by the council century four trillion twenty two billion six hundred and ninety six million four hundred and sixty two c o d with a view to the adoption of a european parliament and council directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states concerning pressure equipment rapporteur mr meier

according to international and community law then the project owner namely nord stream ag must apply for an implementation permit or for a construction permit from the countries which have jurisdiction over the works to be carried out these countries being germany denmark finland and sweden
nevertheless i call into question the fact that when the commission encounters problems with the partners participating in particular projects it attributes at least half of these problems to the partners themselves
we totally and immediately refute this argument because if the current climate of suspicion continues together with a weakened and discredited commission any danger lies in the negative aspects of the current debate being transmitted to and injecting the other debate
we are also developing an action plan
he has quoted kant hegel and carl schmitt but tellingly he has not quoted socrates who himself had a somewhat modern sexuality
as regards the amendments which propose replacing the term of the principle of equal treatment of men and with the term of equality between men and throughout the proposal we cannot support these amendments because this would go beyond the legal basis of article thirteen of the treaty
a number of these ideas are found in the corpus jurist study which parliament has had done
we are aware of our progress with regard to observing this agreement
the fourth commission report outlining the present situation and assessing future prospects with regard to the disposal of radioactive waste in the european union should be published by the end of the year
we must not allow the low social standards in some of the new member states to be used as a battering ram to reverse the social achievements of more advanced member states
however even an approach as good as the one in this communication does not necessarily lead to direct action
i welcome the policy set out by the european parliament the commission and the british presidency regarding this issue
if we do that we will not need a new competitiveness pact because we will have already achieved our objective
my second supplementary question is this what approach is being adopted
for example it suggests that multinationals should develop a sense of responsibility and set up ethical investment committees and should apply a fair but unspecified trade system and an overall trade liberalisation policy
that is why i would ask you to approve the report of the committee on the environment public health and consumer protection
they will of course be very much higher
furthermore i should not like to forget the events of the last few weeks in the fruit and vegetable sector which are proof that the new cap must also provide crisisresponse instruments for all the sectors concerned instruments that are efficient expeditious and adapted to the needs of each individual sector
the whole idea is to raise visibility of the topic itself it is a way of attracting attention and giving extra focus to a particular subject
we would like to see this initiative of europe and the united states take shape also specifically in monterrey when the seven is activated
question no nine by h four thousand four hundred
using the word in another way undermine it completely
not only are the accounts unacceptable but some of the judgements on how public money is used are unacceptable too
i think that whatever your opinion may be whether you are for or against fridays and whether you are for or against strasbourg our parliament would benefit most if we were not to argue every friday about the quorum and i also told the bureau this if we were not to hold any votes this coming friday
finally millions were spent on liquid on planes without serious debate
we also welcome explicit references to fundamental rights such as the possibility of copying data from the previous application if the last entry is not older than fifty nine months instead of forty eight as well as guarantees for secure data protection
everybody now says that they want a constitution but one of the frustrations of being in the presidency is that everyone says they want to achieve success but this is always qualified with a but
it is vital that social and political ties between eu citizens continue to be strengthened
this changes nothing in terms of our own assessment of our presidency of course
all these things make sense if the beneficiaries can access the information
clear and enforceable rules to protect the privacy of all european citizens in all eu countries must form an inherent part of the constitutional rights as laid down in the european charter
if the social dimensions the social development of our new europe is not driven forward purposefully or with the necessary sensitivity we are heading ever more certainly for new social conflicts and that is particularly the case in the border regions of the european union
question no seven by h fifty five thousand nine hundred and ninety nine
i see this difficult delicate compromise as a step forward for apart from anything else it includes many of the points proposed by parliament at first reading
this time the european union needs to send a very strong signal that there cannot be a partnership with azerbaijan without democracy and human rights there
i would have liked to add that there are cultural reasons which is after all what you would expect
the commission can accept in principle amendments nos one six twenty twenty one and twenty three
yes because there are also specific european industrial sectors that are proving that they do
the first is qualified majority voting
mrs kuneva and mr orban have a great deal to contribute to europe
it has all the right talents the economic clout of twelve of the fifteen member states of the eu low rates of inflation falling national debts and historically low interest rates
these people are exploited as a result of their illegal situation and that is wrong
this is a nontechnological item so the socialists should not be frightened of it
it soon became evident that a significant majority of the member states considered that the commissions proposals on quality standards were overambitious and that they would be overly expensive similarly it was clear from discussions in the council that there was a desire to distinguish between quality standards for coastal waters and quality standards for inland waters
it might be the late hour but i very much support what they have said here tonight
freight transport logistics represents thirteen of the unions gross domestic product and one thousand and fifteen of the final cost for products is represented by the cost of transport logistics
i can still remember your appearance on german television
if the market needs to be harmonies then all the countries must be put on an equal footing and we cannot thus ban the sponsorship of sports and cultural events by the tobacco industry in one country whilst a neighboring country still permits it
this is not just because the current legal solutions in this area are inadequate it is most importantly because of its significance for everyone living in the eu
neither do i believe that our institution can reasonably overlook the correlation between them
it should be noted that both sides regard multilateral action as essential based on the united nations system and within the framework of the world trade organization
we also need to set up a second european monetary system
that in turn would contribute to a reduction in prejudice a limiting of stereotypes and a growth of the hope that never again will we in europe experience totalitarianism
these amendments were essential to the preservation of the n h s in scotland and the u k as a whole
the commission and parliament have combined in setting up a service called europe direct through which people can very quickly obtain answers via the internet or over the telephone about where they should apply in order to obtain the information they require this is a service that has already been very well received by the people of europe
asylum and immigration
the council is determined to continue the dialogue and to address the human rights issue
the potential benefits deriving from the implementation of the services directive are incontrovertible
however the recent fear of a clash between cultures is not groundless
because when he was in belgrade just after the rigged yugoslav elections he managed to get a complaint made and milosevic had to back down
furthermore forestbased industries provide more than two million jobs contributing to economic growth and employment
such conduct is not humanely acceptable and discouraged qualified young people from entering seafaring professions with obvious dangers for world shipping and our seas
i should like to receive a response to this from the council and if possible from the commission because this is of course of major importance for the purpose of publicity and information provided to the dutch people
the preconditions mentioned have not been met and i therefore reject an extension of the disagree area in the strongest possible terms
europes response in every instance has been rapid and united this has allowed us to alleviate some of the devastation and bring a little hope to the victims
we therefore demand full involvement in its implementation after all this is the best guarantee for democratic legitimacy
i would point out that the main problem with article one hundred and three a is that it requires the unanimity of the council whereas an effective mechanism for absorbing asymmetric shocks must by nature be immediate and automatic
the commission adopted its thematic strategy on the urban environment in two thousand and six the strategy recognizes the whole of sustainable urban development in relation to the quality of life but the strategy also recognizes the diversity that exists between citizens in the european union
we are talking about hundreds of thousands of people who require our help hence i believe that it would be a good idea to avoid cutting these budgets
my second comment is that it is essential to encourage an extensive economy and to discourage an intensive economy just as we are against intensive farming
on behalf of the p p e d e group s l three years have already passed since the idea of establishing a european institute of innovation and technology was first aired
in its resolution of the nineteenth of december two thousand and two on the sinking of the prestige and its consequences the european parliament called in particular for flags of convenience to be prohibited in eu territorial waters
member states such as sweden have efficient systems whereby all traps are tested
our fellow member committed a road traffic offense which is a culpable offense but not a crime
to ensure the favorable development of the baltic region it is necessary to create pan european cooperation in which russia too has an equal part in principle this could be done either by accepting russia too as an eu member state or by turning the council of europe into a strong pan european cooperation umbrella
criminalising the people and organizations fighting against fortress europe is not however an effective tactic against the underground networks and smugglers
such activity prevents the effective and sustainable management of fish stocks
sometimes i have the feeling that the council believes that things can just happen by themselves without us having to reprioritise or earmark resources but that is unfortunately not the case
it makes no sense though to destroy today businesses and jobs especially in disadvantages structurally weak areas whether this be done out of anticipatory obedience to the w t o or conceivably for ideological reasons since we will tomorrow have to replace or create anew these jobs with a great deal of effort and expense to public funds using rural development programmes to do it
an end to the conditionality of the cohesion fund to the stability and growth pact and the nonapplication of the n two or three rule to this fund or to the structural fund
ceauşescu too considered oppression of minorities to be a romanian domestic issue just as china has asserted in the case of tibet
we oppose the strengthening of a capitalist and war mongering eu

the dutch government intends to carry out seventeen more shipments in the coming years
next item is the council and commission statements on a world without landings
that is why sharing best practice between countries throughout the eu is so vital
i should like to see a solution on the table very soon because time is pressing and we already have the problems
finally we must not wait for the next disaster to happen before suddenly realizing what is happening and becoming aware of our responsibilities
included in the information that is to be collected and made available to crime prevention authorities are aircraft passengers credit card numbers plane seating requests contact details baggage information frequent flyer information language skills and the age name and contact details of any person accompanying a child on a journey as well as that persons relationship to the child
part of europes destiny is being played out in the near and middle east under the association agreements concluded between the union and these countries we now need to find a middle way that is fair to all sides balancing the pursuit of economic and trade relations against promoting core values
that region is important for the european union from several points of view geopolitically geostrategically and also economically
for objective one regions it is reduced to forty or fifty depending on the poverty of the region concerned and for objective two regions it is limited to ten or twenty the report asks whether such a restriction could be paving the way for the gradual disappearance of national regional aid and in time for the pure and simple banning of such aid
yes in effect it would be a tax but it would be a flexible tax rewarding those who take measures to try to introduce the best technology and to make maximum use of their planes
so if you think about the accession of bulgaria and romania and if we vote on it tomorrow i would be delighted if you could view it in the same way as you view your own countries
although i think it much to be welcomed that war has been declared on corruption in albania i do also think that all the political forces must treat this campaign with the same seriousness for it will not meet with real and lasting success unless they do
it seems that that encouraged the commission to continue with such crimes on a systematic basis

i believe that what is happening now is of crucial importance
the european commissions proposal for a directive gives a lot of power to eu bureaucrats

in future it will therefore be necessary for parliament and international and european trade unions to work together and add their positive and urgent recommendations to the initiative voted on here today
for a start we must truly move away from the medical model of disability to the social and rightsbased model of disability

yesterday according to the press there was a meeting of the advisory committee in which it is alleged several member states decided not to support the commissions proposal for action as a tax of about one thousand two hundred and fifteen in particular was mentioned i should like to ask the commissioner what actually happened at the meeting yesterday
in this instance the solutions proposed to improve the fight against fiscal fraud involve the living of tax in the country of origin and the setting up of a clearing house that would make individual member states tax receipts dependent on transfers made by other member states

the situation is so different between the north and the south

it is this type of activity which in my groups view does more than anything to demonstrate to europes people that the governments when they come together are only concerned with a headlong rush to outperform each other and prove their much credentials
you are right mr president of the commission to say that what matters most in future is the social europe but it is important that instead of us just talking about it the european union must take action once and for all in the eyes of the public only actions count
how do we distribute the money between the different member states

f r mr president ladies and gentlemen i should like first of all to thank mr rocard for this report which conveys much objectivity on the european unions exclusively bilateral relations with the arab world

it is not only a formality but a very important moment
it is absolutely necessary to continue expanding specific actions and programmes to support women
will you reconsider this proposal or will it be jettisoned for good
it is a particularly important issue which requires an immediate response from the european commission
consequently i welcome the fact that the report is focused on two key ideas in this regard
i ask you to conduct a serious and immediate investigation into what happened
it is however very important that we apply the precautionary and principles and that we respect anxiety faced with something new
we also ask the directorate general for competition to concern itself with the distribution channels especially in the media and with the dominant position of individual branches of industry in this area and to investigate cases of abuse but not to throw out the baby with the backwater

we need to make sure that the regulatory framework of the global financial markets catches up with the reality of how the world economy looks today

as far as the many thefts in the buildings are concerned it is unacceptable that despite an extensive security service these can take place more or less on a daily basis

this cannot last any longer we must address this issue now
in its current form however neither market interventions nor excessive administrative costs for business can be ruled out

our task is not to live in the past or to adopt a position in favour of or against india and pakistan

this a compromise and it will have to be a compromise

we have managed where protection against defamation in the press is concerned to come up with a compromise that i see as protecting and supporting press freedom one of the european unions fundamental values which we must treat with respect and which must be central to what we do and which is best protected if the legal consequences can be discussed in the country in which the newspaper or medium is based
i am a very open person as you know

we consider the changes to the wording – i am referring here to amendments thirty six thirty eight thirty nine forty and forty one from preparing for example to drafting working through its executive director or the need for the endorsement of member states and the change from instructions to operational guidance – as a weakening of the text in spite of the good intentions of mrs attwooll

this means that if we want to ensure that our citizens are safe and free both of these values must be promoted beyond the borders of the european union but a balance should always be struck between them
it is obvious that in countries such as italy this law is superfluous because the period on full pay is much longer than the minimum period laid down by the directive and the periods when women can be absent from work to look after their children extend up to eight years of age

i do not see that the securities and exchange commission has done any harm in the united states

there is a risk of the eu not being so unanimous in its approach to russia as this debate suggests
through tax concessions as mr van der waal said but on the other hand we must also realize that our schools of maritime navigation have to stay open for foreigners too

do you find it acceptable that the union has member states for instance the united kingdom that do not have a unified written constitution

this means europe can continue to flout the rights of migrants either here or there for it has actually made very few commitments in its migration mobility and employment action plan

finally i would like to make an observation of a rather personal nature
the truth is that it has come upon us

speaking of energy consumption policies the eu should take the statements made by the renowned british economist nicholas stern as a guide to its choices there are more incentives to invest in energy efficiency during a recession and when oil prices are high spending on renewable and other lowcarbon industries could help stimulate the economy
and that was my hope
and we need more europe rather than less europe and the important thing is to move on from words to actions

what is really going on here
as regards the subjects which concern the activity of my committee in particular i must highlight two points which involve parliament as a whole and of course the group i belong to as well
public contracts represent important economic opportunities for companies are very important in the promotion of the single market stimulate innovation and promote the protection of the environment and climate as well as social inclusion public procurement policy should ensure that public money is used as efficiently as possible and should keep public procurement markets open thereby contributing to the relaunch of the eu economy to job creation and to welfare

a european network of national europass centres will also be established
how are we seeking to undermine this
madam president in the proposal for a regulation on trains european communications networks it is noted as in the case of other networks that there has been no progress in the implementation of the projects of community interest as a result of the lack of funding either private or by the member states concerned
there is not enough investment in research our public spending is at the same level as in the united states and the private sector must make more effort
mr president i wish to make just two comments

let me finish by once again thanking mrs striffler for her work on this issue and calling upon parliament to continue the discussion on this topic
we are continuing to monitor the situation in the region and sharing the information we have with the council and the member states and we are prepared to take any other possible measures which might help to resolve the conflict
are there any other comments on the minutes
on a more serious note democratic scrutiny of these declarations is of course pitiful
it has an awful lot to do with it as former un special rapporteur on the right to food jean ziegler clearly explained in the periodical l e monde diplomatique in march this year
there is simply no truth in this
so i think that mistakes were made
those were my comments on the amendments proposed for the articles
a second point which is also quite important is that we have to take into account the crisis that we are experiencing in such a context of crisis we must take this opportunity to convert and retrain the labour market so as to avoid negative social impacts

naturallyproduced foods untainted by excessive use of pesticides et food with real favour and nutritional value are increasingly what european consumers are quite rightly demanding europes farmers food manufacturers and supermarkets should be adapting to meet that demand
it was back in the nineteen nineties when socialist governments were in power that this development took root
i really cannot tell you how the immigrants from rwanda sierra leone and myanmar actually get to greece but the basic problem you have raised is one that is currently being discussed in depth in the council and the council intends to cooperate more closely in this area and to take decisions and decide on joint action here at the latest by the time of the special summit to be held in tampere in finland during the next sixmonth presidency
i should also say to mrs ayala sender that i remember our visit to zaragoza where we had the opportunity to see the benefits of all the work currently being done in europe on developing logistics
the report concludes that member states stand only to benefit if the eu decides to do more for this sector of the fishing industry it is impossible to argue with such a conclusion in view of the community tuna fleet and loss of competitiveness along with the major contribution of these areas to the eu – the canning industry provides around jobs in the eu and tuna accounts for almost sixty of total tinned fish production
i should like to say in fact that facing this new situation it would be very hypocritical for us to stand by and hope that problems of this type and with such impact can be dealt with by national legislation
it offers the rebels various ministerial posts and also the important presidency of a committee authorized to exploit and export minerals
i believe that as is stated in nineteen of the report the current provisions for the internal market and competition ensure in itself that in this and other sectors public measures where necessary are adopted within the context of the rules already laid down by the treaties guaranteeing that the economy providing public services is competitive and dynamic

firstly sugar is used for making cakes and pastries not wine
i would also like to point out that this discussion on the unfair practices of this asian country began in nineteen ninety eight and so far no action has been taken against the republic of south korea but rather we spend time discussing whether or not it is a good idea to include one category or another in the defence mechanism which the european commission designed nearly two years ago
a few days ago the commission said it was its own objective to be able to welcome ten new member states by the year two thousand and five

i am thinking here of nimruz and herat
the commissions communication is predictably cautious and europe must take a lead at u n g a s s in calling for a more farreaching programmer in particular to demand binding environmental legislation and targets
it is obvious that safeguarding the our is not just in the interest of the member states in the our area
hu mr president i desire mercy and not sacrifice the words of jesus echo in our souls when we encounter rampant violence and cruelty in the world
i declare the standpoint thus amended to be accepted
thus european regulations are not shining examples of clarity and comprehensibility

article seventy five is one of the provisions of the convention implementing the schengen agreement and this seeks to allow travellers to carry narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances in connection with medical treatment
the greatest responsibility in this area falls to the commission
it has even been said that in the interests of democracy they should have to put their television and radio at the disposal of their aggressors
however although many people have internet access these days not everyone does

so the basic principle reads a weak our is good for an exportoriented economy and hence good for europe
the second sensitive issue is the western sahara
as for the second objective we are entirely convinced that the interests of sustainable mobility would be best served if the communitys supply lines did not converge on a small number of major ports but if a thoroughly decentralised system were used with numerous peripheral ports thereby avoiding a great many overland transport operations and making the transport system easier on the environment
one of the arguments in favour of passing the new bill is that these organizations are a tool used by third countries to conduct foreign policy in russia
however such massive decisions would require courage and strength from our politicians it goes without saying that the banks cannot be allowed to lead parliament on a merry dance any longer
i would also like to express my gratitude for and recognition of the consensus which has existed in the committee on budgets in relation to this issue

there is of course no direct effect of antibiotics on the genes but there is an indirect link insofar as antibiotics can affect natural selection that is natures own evolutionary process
we need to secure ourselves against a future crisis by increasing our gas storage capability energy solidarity requires crossborder connections joining the transmission networks of individual countries

that is why this issue of going to the committee on legal affairs and citizens rights is so important
all the more so in that all the political powers of europe want theoretically at least to promote the railways because they are an environmentallyfriendly means of transport

we must not lose sight of the fact that with enlargement we have the potential to increase the number of visitors who come to europe s shores to see some of the traditional cultural heritage that has not been opened up to the world for quite a number of years in fact about forty years
as the commissioner has already mentioned we are working to a very tight timetable as the continued funding of many european institutions and the support for nongovernmental organizations associations trade unions and educational institutions in the next financial year cannot be secured without passing a legal act
a good balance has been achieved between the concepts of flexibility and security and also between the interests of all the stakeholders in the process in particular social partners and public authorities

there are places where this could be done
conversely watering down the services directive could deliver a devastating blow to the principles of equality and solidarity

i regret that we are debating this report just before midnight
there is no pandemic
i presume there will be a debate as well as the rule specifies

it was quite fair that there should be solidarity among women and solidarity among men

on the basis of this regulation member states will be able to provide some practical facilitation such as specific border crossing points reserved for border residents and give them the possibility in very exceptional cases to cross the border outside authorized border crossing points

on behalf of the i n d d e m group mr president yesterday we enjoyed a wonderfully clever speech by the french president
will the council say whether it will allow a member state virtually to paralyze eu business by preventing all decisiontaking and jeopardizing by its behaviour the attainment of treaty objectives what developments does it foresee
the conventions are of course concerned with the relationship between states and citizens and since the eu is not a state the fact that the eu increasingly behaves like and is acquiring the powers of a state is a problem in that way a loophole has appeared in connection with fundamental rights and this loophole should of course be closed
i know that things would be different if we had the constitution
what now do the phrases the fight against social exclusion or the guarantee of adequate social protection contained in article nine signify to those citizens

mr president the position of the cultural and creative industry forms part of the european strategy for innovation and the eu twenty twenty strategy and is closely connected with measures aimed at the more effective use of monuments museums and gallery collections or urban and rural units in tourism and related activities the digitisation of historical and cultural content represents the main opportunity in this regard

p l mr president it should be admitted that the tactic the european union has used till now including at the copenhagen summit was wrong

the fund will also support projects aimed specifically at combating discrimination in the work place which can be linked to the priority of enhancing the social inclusion of disadvantages citizens in particular with a view to providing them with sustainable employment
you are no doubt aware that the structuring of public finances was suspended in nineteen ninety eight because the nominal deficit which was twenty one in nineteen ninety eight compared with nineteen ninety seven when it was twenty five hides the fact that there was no reduction in the structural deficit
to date hamas has not taken any action to distance itself from its own founding document which includes destroying the state of israel as one of its objectives therein lies the political problem which has escalated into an armed conflict terrorism on one side and tough defensive actions on the other
i have to tell mrs grossetête that the difference between us and the united states is that we boast a sound social security system that should also balance its books those of you in this house who argue in favour of six months protection are also those who very often caution in their own countries that the social security budget must be kept under control and that cuts must be made
we are not entirely pleased with the mandate but we feel that it shows political realism
thirdly the state of technological development means that h g v s in emission categories three and four should lose their ecopoint liability altogether
no one is interested in us the reason for this above all is our inability to reform the way we work
as an itinerant critic of the constitution however i have not been in any country with more opposition to it
here preparations are more advanced as we have all known for some time that it would be a priority
like all the other candidate countries turkey is required to fulfill all the conditions
i have made a note that romania wants to join the system as soon as possible under the supervision of the commission subject to any technical adjustments that might be necessary in this regard
this type of machinery operates very satisfactorily
thank you mr moorhouse
how can we govern such a huge and open cosmopolitan area
five common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organizations and for the relevant activities of maritime administrations recast
mr president what we need now is stability
i also agree with its social policy measures which will help tackle the demographic challenge in the european union
i repeat my longstanding criticism that the structures mean that abuses are inherent in the system
these people are unfairly having to pay fees to lawyers and other experts in order to defend themselves in the courts without much chance of success
there is much that we can learn from each other in these areas
on the one hand unfettered commercial activity as we all know can destroy the environment
we also do not support taiwans efforts to become a member in international fora because if such membership implies statehood that is not possible according to the consequent policy that we have
mr bendtsen also mentioned the basel criteria with which we are all familiar
as an irish member of the european parliament and coming from an economy that has been transformed in fifteen years from the weakest in the eu to one of the strongest i wish to acknowledge the huge role that the cohesion and structural funds have played in bringing about the economic miracle known as the
the financial issue is also important for the stability of our social security systems and the guarantee of access to healthcare for all
for this regulation the european commission has given us e u r million
this is already the third such catastrophe in europe alone in the last twelve years
these measures are a direct result of member state decisions and therefore should be funded by general taxation not by the passenger who is already fleeced when travelling by air
the situation developing there is really deplorable
in fact in the whole of the northern part of cyprus there is a plethora of turkish flags present not eu flags
humanitarian aid now has a larger and more important role than in the past
to put it simply all the parties involved finally said that they were not one hundred satisfied with this compromise nor was it ideal but they could live with it
slack procedures without any followed or inspection only foster suspicion and ambiguity
applause unemployment which is also a social crisis and can become a political crisis can only be tackled through european cooperation
the member states are aware of this and fully intend to safeguard them the logic behind schengen is unchanged ever more efficient management of the external border is the precondition for travelling without border controls within the schengen zone
the commission analysis has shown that fragmentation of both production and marketing has contributed to the difficulties faced in recent years by the softfruit sector
on the other hand despite the increasing importance of our work after the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon i believe that we as a parliament must show responsibility and political commitment and do our part in giving this balkan country early next year already the assistance it needs now rather than discussing it at length and being able to give the assistance only at some unknown point of time in the future
the member states have agreed unanimously to this last proposal as mr reynders has said
the truth is that either we shall go bankrupt or we shall not be as secure as citizens these are the facts
we hope that the european council will consider a new and more democratic formula for the european union
we hope the leaders of the two communities will resume unled negotiations after the elections
there are things that have changed very recently and that we are changing again because we have seen that the practice of our parliament demands that those changes be made
for all these reasons we hope that this year with the halfyearly reports from the commission and joint monitoring body the various institutions of the european union will find adequate answers that satisfy the requirements of the consumers and citizens of the union
voting in favour of these things can only strengthen public confidence in a european market model that is both open and protective
we are also anticipating with interest the legislative initiative on smart energy networks these networks are necessary both to make it possible to obtain electricity generated from renewable energy resources in which member states have made huge investments in recent years and to prepare the necessary infrastructure for electric vehicles
accordingly it must as a matter of urgent priority be translated fully into practical reality
i have no time let us not lose sight of the fundamentals here
my group has expressly mandated me to state that we consider it irresponsible for a head of government in this case the german federal chancellor to make enlargement conditional on the results achieved in negotiations on the agriculture chapter with regard to payments
on the other hand the conclusion of an agreement with switzerland would mean that as from the year two thousand and five forty tone h g v s could drive through switzerland quite freely and the roads charge system would be fair
and now that we have in fact reached the legislative stage i would like to ask that this stage be speeded up as much as possible in parliament and that it progresses quickly at first reading so that on the seventeenth of november if possible the council can adopt a common position and so that we might already have this framework agreement before the end of the year
i come from a country in which whenever i go to the supermarket i see a man riding a moved with a wooden box on the back
i have already said that there is a structured dialogue and so a series of conversations take place regularly with china on this subject
i have just been informed unfortunately that we have a problem with the availability of our commissioners
we must also adapt the administrative rules to the specific constraints faced by s m e s
we have asked the commission to compile information and guidelines to ensure that the information supplied to patients is genuinely independent
it is distant from reality particularly since i for and the c j t f are such important parts of the european security structure and since france has returned or is returning to the administrative structures of n a t o
we do not hesitate to talk about models when we are discussing social issues we talk about the european social model which combines responsibility personal initiative and solidarity
it is not clear how long the exogenous costpush will last
we should not have to go there in thirty years time like the belgians in rwanda and say sorry or like the holy father who is frustrating himself all over the place
i believe that we have a plan for profound change that can be evaluated is binding and is in line with our objectives and our ambitions
the increase in external economic pressure due to the current financial crisis and substantial variations in fuel prices is worsening existing pressures resulting from fleet undercapacity and erosion of the resource base
the marginal reduction in the emission of pollutants that was desired could only be achieved with a large degree of financial expenditure this was about keeping things in proportion
ro i would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur mr gauzès
we recommend improving the approach to drawing up reports and declarations presentation dates must be brought forward and guidelines must be issued in more precise terms avoiding ambiguity specifying possible observations and reservations and more clearly outlining plans of action
incredibly simple
i now turn to the proposal for a directive on the taxation of savings
if anyone is afraid of that there is absolutely no need to be
among other aspects worthy of note a majority in this parliament has tried in this resolution through a tortuous exercise to question what the o s c e election observation mission has not questioned for example the democratic legitimacy of the elected parliament and to urge use of the eus financial resources for operations of interference
are we dreaming here
i look forward to more debates and to cooperating closely with you in future in the area of sport including football
this should become standard practice for our legislation
it ensures respect for human rights and for the dignity of the individual
more has been lost however than just the name and the symbols
i trust that on this basis we can consider that we have a political agreement and that the commission proposal can go forward for adoption by the council as amended following the adoption of parliaments opinion
thanks to the amendments which the members of the presidential majority tabled in the committee on regional development eligibility for the fund is vested not only in the new member states of the eu but in all twenty seven all of which face the same difficulties
and effectively provision is made for an additional subsidy of e c u one zero that is five thousand sixty francs
let us not allow silly shouting professional ignorance and unfinished work to impair the eus credibility we need to continue to be partners in this important game
in writing el the roma are almost invariably victims of racial discrimination
six years on from that decision only half of these projects have made any real progress and those projects are by and large concentrated in the northern half of the continent
at last i could see where the meetings were that i was supposed to attend and i could even see the news on b b c world giving details of that most important election the conservative party leadership
i chose to abstain because although this text mentions identifying possible savings for next years budget these are not made specific within the text
they are being tried separately from the moslems charged with them which proves if proof were needed that this trial which we are told is to be adjourned is no genuine trial
i also support the request for the writeoff of sovereign debt to no longer be regarded as an integral part of official development assistance
b four million fifty two thousand two hundred and ninety seven o ten thousand six hundred and ninety seven by mr teverson and mr eisma on behalf of the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party to the commission on the illegal network important c f c products from china and russia into the european union b four million fifty two thousand three hundred and ninety seven o ten thousand seven hundred and ninety seven by mr dupuis and mr macartney on behalf of the group of the european radical alliance to the commission on illegal imports of c f c s
i would stress however that as for last year the council considers that this margin should not be used for the requirements of any single institution
yesterday i spoke to mr patten on this matter and hope there will be some development in this regard involving not only parliament but the european union as a whole
the commission was backed up by a host of letters from associations which were benefiting from these illegal appropriations
i would like to highlight a confusion which is often made between the number of children who have been separated from their parents but are in the care of the protection system and the number of children available for adoption
finally in the present tragic circumstances it is imperative that an international conference should be convened for the purpose of improving the coordination of humanitarian aid
there is starting to be a surfeit of halfbaked intergovernmental conferences
therefore on the twentieth of december the college approved a proposal for a regulation which has just been sent to the council and to parliament prohibiting the transport of heavy oils by singlehull oil tankers destined for or originating from european union ports and speeding up the replacement of this type of oil tanker by doublehull oil tankers
the current european rail network needs improvement and coordination in view of both the congested road network and environmental concerns
i know that parliament follows this with particular interest
this is particularly important where enlargement is concerned and legislation and in relation to treaties which entail changes being made to legislation
there may be a motion of no confidence or maybe not that is not the issue at present
today in a way the success of cancún means that we have to call a halt to the strategy of saying that if the others take no action we will take no action
fortunately legislative rules do not apply for ever at the appropriate time they can be improved
mr president i would very much just like to add to two particular points
that is not a point of order
in a few months the european parliament will submit recommendations as to whether we should continue tearing down that fence or build an even higher one
being in favour of the accession of bulgaria and romania to the european union does not mean turning a blind eye to the problems that both countries must resolve before they join the eu however
is that what we want to achieve
european agriculture will always remain critical to the wellbeing of european rural economies indeed it represents the main option for economic activity
it goes without saying that if one scales down makes economic savings and cuts back in fifteen member states simultaneously without introducing stimulation for the economy that unemployment will be high
the provisions which seek to soften the economic conditions attached to residence in exceptional circumstances need more work and clarification before a further reading
in other words will we decide not to sign as long as india has not signed the non proliferation treaty
draft amendment no eight hundred and ten
i should now like to turn to a point of an entirely different order
i would like to ask the commissioner why the commission did not react any sooner
on the basis of our rules of procedure this means that the matter must be referred back to the committee on budgetary control and the debate must continue between parliament and the commission
parliament adopted the decision and the resolution in successive votes
that seems to me a very relevant consideration as to whether we should accept this oral amendment
the basis for this was and still is the passport for each individual animal which provides information on place origin and birth
for our part as italian members we shall still make every effort to persuade our government to change its position and agree to extend the european arrest procedure to all the crimes included in the european commission s proposal and to give up the extradition procedure which would be a patent violation of the spirit and letter of the commitments unanimously and formally adopted in ghent and brussels in the emotional aftermath of the tragic attack on the twin towers
from another perspective the rapporteur also referred to the need to adjust financial or macrofinancial aid to the federal republic of yugoslavia
author like myself the commissioner is totally a u fact with the irish situation where eighteen zero workers cross the border every day from one jurisdiction to another and where five two hundred students and seventeen million people either take holidays or go shopping from one side of the border to the other
it appears to me that the unanimous adoption of mr böges report to the committee on budgets shows that he has found the common denominator in the views of various political groups
the mission will be called nautilus i i and will be sent to the central mediterranean it will depart as planned within a few days and of course i hope as many member states as possible will take part in it not just the mediterranean countries
the technical changes proposed by the commission concerning the title and scope of the directive to make the inclusion of gaseous fuels possible in the future do not cause any problems for the industry concerned
even better we are going to do more for a bargain so that it only looks like we are doing more
we now await the actions of the commission and the council i wonder what measures they will instigate
we are talking here about security energy trade transport or more generally about stability and the development of the regions bordering on the eu regions where we have major interests
this is not the time for long speeches mr president but you deserve your victory
the belgian presidency would be doing itself credit by bringing this affair to a successful conclusion however commissioner you have just told us that proposals will be forthcoming before the summer
they have the pathetic quality of such statements up to and including where they repeatedly affirm that with the crisis coming to an end the eu will build a stronger economy for the future and where they reaffirm the lisbon strategy while in fact it is going completely off the rails
well i can see that the treaty of lisbon has not arrived at harbor as a pile of bones but that its essence is still there
i am pleased that our proposal to retain the current monitoring bodies was approved but regret the fact that all of the others were rejected
it is vital that any action taken in response to these atrocities does not trigger more attacks like it or even worse
nonetheless the fact remains that population growth must be vigorously tackled
mr moorhouses draft resolution and i am merely asking to get a resolution that reflects the truth states that the united nations commission expressed its condemnation it did no such thing
mr president i thank the honorable members for their comments on the commission statement
the first was rationalization in terms of information policy the agencies and nomenclature
finally i expect the whitehead report to carry overwhelming support in the vote this morning
from a security perspective the extent to which power plants can counter such potential threats is very much open to question
i very much fear that the number of officials filling in forms is going to increase
in most cases this situation is due to colonialism and to the exploitation of their riches and peoples
we should make sure in future that we reach fewer firstreading agreements
we already have laws in the european union that have introduced the principle of pay for equal work at an equal into legislation in the crossborder provision of services
this will be an essential element in preparing our final report for the european council in june
they are constantly striving to improve their internal organization so as to respond to the needs of the petitioners i am sure all those present in the house today will be aware that my group and i are not inclined to mince our words when it comes to the european commission
the cumulative effect of these inequalities is manifested in significant differences in terms of life expectancy
the case of gilad shalit demonstrates the particular concern the european union has for the humanitarian situation in gaza
the socrates programmer is aimed at european cooperation in education and promotes cooperation in these areas in particular within the context of open and distance learning
this would relaunch the p o s e i m a programmer making the most of what is efficient and bringing it into the new areas
the european parliament has been calling for this for a long time and we must continue to urge it
i do not now mean the criminal elements that have turned the war into a means of making money
although the proposal basically entails a codification of the unchanged provisions of the regulations mentioned above i am voting in favour of this report on the proposal for a council regulation euratom because the guaranteed maintenance of high levels of protection for european citizens health is in danger
this madam president is not an issue for legal experts but a point that can be easily understood by any citizen to know that he or she is a citizen of a european union with its own personality which can and should govern democratically and transparently and they demand it fulfill its responsibilities
p t if i might mention lack of transparency the charter of fundamental rights states that in europe no one shall be condemned to the death penalty or executed
privatesector expenditure on education is four times as high in the united states and twice as high in japan as it is here in europe
the rapporteur claims that circus is there for young and old for children of all and i would like to follow that up with something with which pipo the clown who was a famous dutch clown always used to end his television shows birds goodbye flowers goodbye
those are areas that have been uninhabited over a long period because it requires more effort to earn a living
the single market and the concomitant union policies are responsible for the disintegration of the public sector of the economy and for the formation by means of mergers of gigantic private monopolies which are replacing state monopolies they are responsible for the takeover in the airtransport sector by american airline companies and the total downgrading of the european shiprepair industry which in just a few years has seen its productive capacity reduced by eighty seven and limited to a much smaller share of the world market than south korea
in our view the basic objective in this connection should be to step up competition in favour of the citizen and to determine the preconditions on that basis
we will also ensure that that these concerns are taken into consideration by the commission for it is the commission that is responsible for putting forward proposals of this type
it will clearly show europe s aim of reducing our impact on the climate and actively taking part in global cooperation
and we support the proposals on decommissioning reactors phrasing out nuclear power and storing radioactive material
the oral question on the stability plan in ireland and france is scheduled for five hundred and thirty p m
hu i would like to ask my fellow member a brief question which is as follows do you think the fact that the irish government can call a referendum as many times as it wants is part of the democratic process
the latter is becoming organised and unfortunately is proving to be increasingly profitable health is gradually becoming a competitive market
it is good that parliament is trying to speak as one although these words are at times inept and sometimes reveal great incompetence
this is the kind of card we have in mind so far as the model is concerned
it would lead to a marked weakening of parliaments role as up to now the commission has been accountable to parliament alone and parliament alone has been able to dismiss the commission
ensuring that minors do not have access to broadcasts or services for adults in the field of audiovisual services is obviously a very important issue
the rapporteur made a wise remark based on the reality of the situation he stated that on its own treatment of the symptoms through increased controls will not be effective
yet at dublin castle on the thirtieth of november you urged ireland to ratify the current text of the constitutional treaty surely this will be a pointless exercise if as you said in italy there is no chance of the current text being implemented
not only does he have to make proposals but he can at the same time take decisions via the austrian upper house
with regard to your question about this disagreement between parliament and the commission it is obvious that the council would be the last institution to get involved in this disagreement and will leave those two institutions to sort out this potential argument between them
this is why exceptions must be related transitional periods must be short and the traditional rights to sunday rest actively protected and maintained
somehow they had information that at the same time in strasbourg the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe was discussing the situation in russia
in broad terms these are the concerns of the group of the european people s party and of a southern country about the c o m
the proposal paves the way for the increased use of majority decisionmaking over and above what is laid down in the treaty of amsterdam in connection with a common defence and security policy
this is a situation in which only a minority of member states are really interested in compliance for most it comes very low down on their list of priorities
it may well be a very good constitution but if a constitution is announced in may and a vote is held on it in november that gives seven months for the extremists to again find plenty of cause for unrest
firstly strengthening economic governance and initiating the european semester
by that i do not mean that i am against renewable sources of energy however it is necessary to use those that exist naturally in wellconsidered areas of use and in capacities that allow them to renew naturally without any effort to increase production artificially in a headlong attempt to attain binding targets as quickly as possible
this has been evident on a number of occasions when parliament has expressed its opinion on agreements dealing with painless animal traps
in ireland as elsewhere violence against women is a very significant problem with statistics from different reports indicating that one in four women have experienced some form of sexual violence in their lifetime
at least we managed to enforce budgetary discipline they say
the major challenges to this country still remain they are to combat corruption and organised crime and to strengthen the rule of law and restore a rudimentary modern economy
mr president honorable members ladies and gentlemen when the lights went out across europe last week our interdependence as europeans was laid bare for all to see
i must say that i am also pleased that a level playing field is being created for all parties involved in creating environmental damage
mr president this second reading is about interconnections about encouraging competition and preventing incumbents those with a strong position from limiting access by other operators
if mr newman never had his human rights reports adopted it was because he could not refrain from adding every possible item from his domestic party programmer in the united kingdom reasonable points no doubt but items which do not belong in a report on human rights
i agree with mrs pack if we enlarge in two thousand and four we must increase the funding otherwise this programmer will be doomed to failure
it accelerated the procedures involved in obtaining information from other states tax administrations
el madam president without wishing to underestimate the importance of recent decisions passed by the european council the defining quality of european decisions over the last year has been too little too late
to me the european ombudsman has an essential role in building bridges between citizens and the european union
several women s organizations have been calling for some time for all the countries of the world to increase pressure on the taliban
mr president i would firstly like to extend my largest congratulations to mrs graenitz on her report things were not easy for her nor did she make them easy for herself
however i am sure that with the proposed measures manufacturers will be asked to maintain unjustifiably high prices as a result of anticompetitive actions
the agreement reached certainly represents a balanced compromise given the many difficulties and the selfishness of the various sectors which quite rightly set down their interests and competences
have there been any deliberations on this with regard to the improvement or protection of legal remedies
i would like to end by congratulations the rapporteur warmly once again on behalf of the group of the european peoples party christian democrats and european democrats
he highlights many actions
i hope that the commission and the council can reach agreement on their respective roles in exercising their right to initiatives and in carrying forward the legislative process itself as i have told parliament the task before us is immense and ambitious and the commission needs to have the necessary human resources to respond to this challenge
since we are marking world aids day this week now may be as good a time as any to opt for more funds for health research
that is all other than to thank you for your cooperation and support
the third is the virulence of the crisis and its challenges and despite this the exasperating slowness of the response and decisionmaking mechanisms that are typical of the european union
parliaments opinion is therefore very timely to guide the commission and the council when we define final respective negotiation directives
it is an excellent and timely report and gives us a good opportunity for an update on the intensive developments over the last few months
this own initiative report by the european parliament is intended as a response to the european commissions communication which contains fourteen measures to be taken in order to ensure that the eu takes the lead in the development of these new networks of interconnected objects parliaments report pays particular attention to the question of respect for privacy the ways in which the internet of things can benefit the quality of life of european consumers and the accessibility and inclusive character of the internet of things
rapporteur da mr president ladies and gentlemen citizens of the eu this report is the result of extensive work in the committee on petitions involving members from all political groups
but this of can never get off the ground until member state governments explain to their people what they are doing together in brussels and why and until we give the union the money and the legal powers to push through initiatives like the common energy policy which faces an uphill struggle against blocking forces in the council as too do many other initiatives in the field of justice and home affairs for example where the absence of qualified majority voting so often results in stalemate
f r mr president inaudible galileo the first community infrastructure requires all stakeholders to share the same goal success
to cite an example in austria there are farmers engaged in production
as mrs avilés perea said gender should be central to the roundtable discussion on social exclusion and poverty
mr president i wanted to speak briefly on the explanations of vote on the iivari report in order to thank mrs iivari and to declare that it was with much conviction that i voted in favour of this report which has now clarified a number of points and created the conditions for the necessary means to be used especially where the european bureau for lesser used languages and mercator are concerned whilst of course the other issues in this report are close to my heart this one is particularly so
existing humanitarian aid projects being run by n g o s in the region have been reorganized to provide the most urgently needed aid
many member states give better treatment in terms of tax deduction for contributions and taxation of benefits to schemes operated by institutions established within their own territory
we are particularly concerned to note the existence of vast mined areas which claim thousands of victims – mostly children – and which prevent people from returning to their homes from cultivating their land and from starting their lives afresh following military conflict
for instance public service platforms could be the standardbearers of the digital switchover
on the contrary criticisms were voiced at the time that it would probably not be enough for enlargement it was said though out of fear of the net contributors that we still had the reserves and that we could call on them if it came to that
they have demonstrated that these institutions are not just a talking shop but also a source of practical aid
– mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen s m e s in developing countries are generally microbusinesses and one of the problems they have to face is that many of them work on an informal basis that is to say in the black economy
how one can have capital punishment and at the same time ask to join the european union is something that still astound me but i am even more astonished that there is talk of granting candidate status to a country that has not yet abolished capital punishment
mr president i should like to take this opportunity following what has been said today to comment on the eus stand on the events taking place around us in the arab world
it is therefore a horrible irony that the united states is one of the few countries in the developed world which still retains and practices the use of the death penalty
we therefore need to be a lot more careful about how we spend money
cooperation between the commission and the presidency has been exemplary and fruitful focusing on the objectives of the pact of confidence for employment
the council is not present here as its representative preferred to attend an informal meeting
i will make four points
i agree with the honorable members position there was no supplementary question that the council too has the same keen awareness of developments in chechnya and is trying through constant contact cooperation and consultations with russia and the un commission on human rights to push things in the right direction
in this way the european policies on environmental protection regional development and regional cohesion will be strengthened for the wellbeing of our fellow citizens and future generations
building these craft often takes a long time and is a leisure activity in itself
we have all come a very long way since last august
if we cannot agree on our common cause then we cannot hope to punch at our collective weight
up to now this agency which has only been in operation for one year has not been allocated enough resources to do its work
in response to the submission of the report the presidentin office of the council applauded the nineteen ninety eight budget
this should be changed
the report also contributes towards a certain europeanlevel party awareness whereby we – who become organised in an attempt to take responsibility for the world – can understand that these organizations have also acquired a new scale
the committee on petitions is in favour of speeding up procedures to ensure that the ombudsmans annual report is considered more quickly and it is also in favour of amending the statute provided that the amendments simply involve a qualitative expansion of the ombudsmans powers without affecting the nature of his competences or the nonbinding effect of all his decisions
it is properly addressed in the report
i wish to thank mr stevenson who i know has worked for many years in order to achieve progress on this matter
with regard to information i believe it is absurd and unacceptable to indicate the specific languages in which the information must be provided
in writing i welcome this initiative by the institutions to establish an eu consensus on humanitarian aid it will provide for the first time a clear statement of eu policy regarding humanitarian aid
c s mr chairman i welcome the fact that we gave the green light to the modern framework for further development of the automotive industry in europe
it is seeking to replace the member states thereby corrupting the spirit of bodies like the united nations general assembly where each country and its people still have the same weight irrespective of their size
the group of twenty one including brazil india china south africa mexico and twelve latin american countries was born of two parents a political father and an agricultural mother
in its conclusions of fifteen and the sixteenth of october two thousand and seven the council taking into account the recent devastation in some member states and recognizing the need for the european union to be able to respond effectively and in a timely manner to crises and emergency situations following natural disasters invited the commission to continue examining the issue and to submit relevant proposals before the meeting of the general affairs and external relations council on the tenth of december two thousand and seven
i would ask you to pay attention in the development of public spending to the fact that there are perfectly legitimate areas of public spending such as investment and education which are sine qua non conditions if we want to meet the future challenges of society
i personally would have liked a greater emphasis on the intergovernmental councilled approach and a meritbased selection of national and eu diplomats as opposed to national quotas as well as some political appointees and why not the odd extreme minister or two
– mr president speaking on behalf of our committee i too would like to express our congratulations to mr annan and to all those who in the united nations work for democracy peace and freedom and our appreciation for all those who have made such great sacrifices for them
we hope to see the oilforfood programmer which is and should be managed by the united nations started shortly
most of the women who are endeared in this way come from regions with adverse economic and social conditions and high unemployment
there is a clear conflict between the two texts
madam president since july nineteen ninety seven the european parliament has been a staunch defender of the autonomy of hong kong under the onecountry twosystems policy
de mr president i would like to raise a point of order for your information it is nice for you to congratulate us for being here today
yes there are things that do not work in our countries
chancellor angela merkel was the first german head of government to receive the dalai lama in berlin
we can do something different but for that we need the will and it needs to be done quickly
however we know from the court of auditors report that even if the underlying transactions were legal and regular for certain parts of the budget there are material errors which still remain for elements of the operational programmes and therefore there is no statement of assurance for the twelfth year running which i think we all underline is totally unacceptable
member states have an obligation to look after the citizens of other member states living in their territories and to ensure dignity and respect for the rights of all citizens of the union no matter where they are living
islam spread through dialogue and flourished by conviction
it was never the responsibility of the farmer it was the food compounds who caused this problem and we have to ensure that it never happens again
in addition you also have a new working document which states the targets that are to be met over the next year for each policy area
a fear that we express if these duties increase and they are to be the counterpart taking the white paper on employment growth and competitiveness of reducing direct taxes on labour how do we make the interconnection we wonder how the commission would propose to try to induce the council with its article ninety nine privileges to do that and not simply to take more tax and ignore the labour taxation
what i am asking you is how we can take a new direction
this proposal does not excessively constrain action by the member states and it should also lead to significantly less subjective error and fewer accidents
we have not reached the point of military action
hu i would like to welcome this report and congratulate the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs
they also play a pivotal role in the cotonou partnership agreement
b five hundred and seven million one hundred and thirty two thousand and one by mr bowis mrs maij weggen and mr deva on behalf of the p p e d e group on the incidents of the twentysecond of october in the state of benue central nigeria
i listened carefully to mr van ordens report on bulgaria having met with meglena kuneva last week to discuss the position
maybe there is a chance of getting this mother to see her son again
best practice should be disseminated and quantitative and qualitative indicators laid down european directives should be implemented in national and regional policy while of course observing the principle of subsidiary and put into practice in national action plans
i wish to express my support for all the democratic forces in these countries and for initiatives aimed at supporting democracy and economic development for the peoples of the caucasus
i therefore put the motion to the vote
it is a very complex report
the computer denied them access but did – since brother is watching – record their names
that is a perfectly legitimate viewpoint

since it cannot meet its energy needs alone the eu is striving to diversify its sources of supply under trade agreements signed with countries in latin america africa and eurasia

author madam president belarus is a beautiful and important country with much potential for progress which can lead to enviable prosperity for its citizens
this report and the debate is also a valuable and appreciated input for another time when we can discuss it on a broader scale
madam president point six on which we have to vote in this amendment stipulates a deadline of the fifteenth of may

b s e was indeed no act of god as certain people tried to tell us at the committee of inquiry but a bizarre mixture of wrong behaviour mismanagement wrong assessment and ignorance and these mistakes demanded that we should draw conclusions from them
we therefore do not understand why the council has decided to stick to a position and a legal basis that does not help us in any way at all instead it blocks any possible way forward
regrettably this discussion has actually been overtaken by the practices of the european patent office
again on behalf of the commission i very much welcome the draft report and i look forward to its adoption in plenary tomorrow
but in seeking i sensed to criticism the british presidency she said cannot put europe together with i would respectfully suggest that we have much more hope of building europe in the direction we would wish if we do so on the basis of our hopes and dreams rather than simply our memories and our past achievements
lastly morocco s refusal is a mystery to me
consequently i wish to express the commissions total satisfaction with parliaments position a position entirely in line with that of the european commission
the council is cowardly and does not have the courage to face up to this problem which is a question of defending human rights

together with ministers pröll and seehofer in the council we succeeded in reaching a compromise that we see as perfectly workable

obviously this does not prevent close cooperation and an excellent understanding between parliament and the council
this is an historical event
i therefore urge you to correct that inconsistency because the commission had two texts one official and one unofficial which differs from it in important ways and in this connection the unofficial text indeed agreed with the previous directive
this will in no small way simplify legislation and eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy
the second point i want to mention is the budget
setting another rule outside the community as in the cases under consideration here i consider to be highly problematic and i believe that all in all we would be well advised to make shutting down the rule not just in eastern europe but for energy policy within the european union as a whole and to not endanger the possibilities of this by carrying out further regulation

this means that illegal cigarettes start coming into the country and so they still end up with less money than they had before
but what i can also say this business of deposits here it is about solidarity this is possible and it is a time when we are able to present a positive picture of the european union in central european countries if we do not hang about one after the other but say together that indeed in a case of crisis we will give a guarantee for the entire populations deposits
anyone who has seen the effects of flood damage as we have in many regions throughout the european union will know how devastating it can be not only to infrastructure but to life and indeed to roads and buildings as the previous speaker mentioned

the european council meeting in dublin will have to give its verdict and parliament will shortly be receiving proposals on these matters from the commission on the legal status of the our the stability pact designed to ensure sound budgetary management and the new european monetary system which will avoid europe being split in two with on one side the countries joining the monetary union at the outset the ins and on the other those which do not join at the outset and are keen to join the reins
given the fact that european political parties play a political role at eu level i agree with the proposal to give them the right to participate in referendum campaigns which are directly related to eu issues and to allow them to use the money they are allocated to finance these campaigns

the second point i would like to raise in this context is that the americans have announced that discussions on kosovos final status could open in two thousand and five should the eu not be preparing for these negotiations this year in two thousand and four at the latest so that it is not presented with a
those of us who are aware of the situation are all very saddened
a common strategy for the black sea area should perhaps slowly complement our synergy and give more substance to our present approach
this is quite a major point
i would therefore urge the liberals not to ask for studies every turn around but to take a decision and not to leave the consumers out in the cold
it would though lead to a dangerous paralysis in the european union and furthermore such a paralysis that there would an even greater threat of people turning away from the european union
we must keep a close watch on our recovery measures especially with unemployment still rising

firstly companies have to be allowed to get on with it following commercial logic
is it reasonable to ask europe to reduce its agricultural production at a time when the world has such great need of foodstuffs i do not think that this is reasonable
months ago we had the opportunity to debate the situation of dairy producers but even then many of us said that the crisis was affecting the other sectors of agriculture
by revitalising rural economic life modernizing agriculture in europe helping to set up young farmers and spreading best practice the rural development funds themselves make an important and welcome contribution to general economic advancement across the european union
personally i am convinced that farming and forestry are easily the most important factors in our efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions particularly if we are to bind carbon in trees plants and roots and fix it in the soil
the system as it is set up was devised with full consideration for openness and transparency as member states should inform the other member states and the commission of what measures they are taking in accordance with this regulation
that is the reason why the commission asks for action
as to the draft mandate for the i g c it may be very precise but it is not necessarily right
the negative effects on civil society for example in europe and russia central asia and iran cannot be underestimated
i endorse the position that this must be an openended process without a predetermined outcome albeit a process that does point towards accession i also share his desire to see that regardless of the outcome turkey presses ahead with and firmly establishes the welcome reforms that it has been carrying out
this lack of data is how can i put it a recurring issue but i think it important to emphasis since it is a shortcoming that we must overcome
mrs remarks about using taxation and social insurance to promote the mobility of artists belong to the culture agenda
mr president one of the most eyecatching features in these recommendations is the tax on financial transactions
and in todays debate you are taking a few steps forward by adopting a few principles and introducing a service
the house that we are building for our citizens should be able to withstand an earthquake
we can set another example here to the effect that parliament is taking action to prevent mismanagement and in particular fraud and to mete out punishment where necessary
i am also pleased that you are making human rights a matter for decision at the highest level but parliament is the assembly that represents the people of europe
our one regret is that we were not more ambitious in recommending that the presumed consent system be adopted across europe
the numerous ways in which womens participation in the structural funds can be increased from pilot projects to raising the proportion of women are also on our common list of requirements
this has been a frequently recurring problem and i ask of the commission that they use their powers to intervene to ensure that this interruption to the free movement of goods and people within the european union is brought under control
i listened carefully to the words of my fellow member from hungary mr tőkés and i have to protest against the resided view of current events and its presentation as a universal attack on the actions of the slovak republic in this area

mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i believe that tonight marks the beginning of a major project which europe the member states and the regions and cities of the european union have been waiting for for a long time a goal that various stakeholders in the fields of education employment trade and the economy have been working towards for years and something that society as a whole wants
unfortunately this proposal was rejected by the majority in parliament
it was for all those reasons that the commission drew up the communication we are debating today it provides a framework for the development of a broad range of telematics services and systems for road transport in a flexible way so as to respond to both local and community needs
i do not want to point my finger or make a prior judgments

a vote in favour of the european commission is on my part an expression of the credit of trust and hope that i place in mr barrosos newlyelected cabinet
on behalf of the s d group ro madam president i too want to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report and the very productive cooperation i received while drafting it
rather than continuing the debate in this parliament on the differences between the constitutional treaty and the treaty of lisbon or on how the member states should go about gratifying the treaty should we not be discussing what we shall do after the treaty comes into force as we hope it will
furthermore i am asking the commission to assess the effectiveness of initiatives taken by the member states and effectively to disseminate best practice
everyone here knows that the cooperation of the member states on economic and financial issues is long overdue that is the cause of this crisis
and yet there are many constitutions even in those very countries which enshrine freedom of religious worship and states have signed international covenants and un conventions which are supposed to guarantee religious freedom
finally i hope that the vote will result in a positive outcome
the summit must produce a mandate to begin and where necessary to enhance the negotiation towards an association agreement with the andean community with central america and with mercosur
yes i agree with you
for the first time it is saying clearly that for the sake of the future of the country and for all the two hundred and sixty nine zero people there dependent directly or indirectly on fishing there must be agreements which appear to work for the benefit of all and not for the interests of a small group
this is why it is vitally important that we find a differentiated approach in order to produce results at a local level because of the different level of development both in different countries and in different sectors
the eu is engaged in numerous multilateral and bilateral trade negotiations with various groups such as the world trade organisation
this is why it is important and we consider it necessary to promote every technical facilitation that will enable these organizations to access the aid that is often crucial to their survival
not all the coalitions in the world will be able to do anything about it they will not be able to paper over public profound crisis of confidence in the united states
it was therefore also good that our two fellow m e p s presented a joint report
the council view has been that we make the creation of a reservation for kosovo a priority
regulation no nineteen million six hundred and seventy two thousand and six meticulously determines the gear authorized for fishing in the waters of the g f c m area in the mediterranean in our particular case
the peace facility really has been a success but the money allocated to it is running out and we need to agree adequate longer funding for it
with mercosur representing forty five of the population of latin america and the regions largest market as well as forty five of its g d p the great potential for growth on both sides is clear
there are many ways in which you may express your views in this house
as ever our main attention is directed at the former yugoslavia
you could say that this is a very exciting task
it is unlikely that these countries will be able to transform themselves into the paragons of virtue they are supposed to be before they can join in one time
we think that your report puts forward additional arguments in favour of integrating the joint research centre into european networks and in particular networks of excellence and we agree with the principles that you mentioned both on ethics and openness

mr president i should like to draw the attention to the fact that the brutal action taken on the part of the turkish police against demonstrators a few days ago has resulted in quite justified protests across europe and even – or should i say at long last – in it being asked somewhat more overtly whether a country such as turkey could be a member or candidate country of the european union at all
two thousand and eight discharge european foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions
i would also point out that citizens have the right to know how the money they pay in taxes is spent and how the unions institutions and political bodies use the powers they are given

we therefore agree with amendment no six but feel that more rigorous studies should be carried out on the use of this type of packaging and of its active materials
there is less red tape

the success of the disengagement process so far encourages both parties to continue their cooperation on the remaining steps of the process not least in their close work with the special envoy for disengagement james wolfensohn
however let me make one thing clear

i am also suspicious of an ideology of progress which was what also inspired the nazis and stalinists and feel that the ethical concerns surrounding this issue are not of secondary importance but should take centre stage because biotechnologies touch on the very heart of life in all its mystery and sanctity
however there is one thing we should be clear about and that is that state pension systems can only be supplemented by good occupational pension systems or private pension funds and schemes otherwise with increasing life expectancy we could sacrifice social symmetry
those public rules are often a marked improvement on the practice in a number of our member states
mr prodi succeeded because he believed in the future of europe
for several years the community has been implementing a complete strategy aimed at making short sea shipping a viable and realistic alternative to purely road transport
it says that the objectives will be decided on by the heads of state or government the undertakings will be made by the heads of state or government and the monitoring will be carried out by the heads of state or government in fact the commission will only be involved in technical monitoring nothing else
this event must not be used as an alibi it must mark the beginning of a real partnership
i would like to see far more emphasis in our dealings with countries in central and eastern europe and the mediterranean areas on energy efficiency
in order to do so we must seriously examine the way we are organised the instruments and procedures we select what is being done at the various levels at institutional national and regional level and how tasks are divided between the three institutions
in the light of our principle stance on this issue we decided to vote against the resolution which does not correspond to our position on a number of important counts
finally i would remind you of the council regulation establishing from the first of january nineteen ninety nine a special aid scheme for a c p states that are traditional banana suppliers

they have divisions over europe and it is overshadowing their conference which is taking place this week in manchester david camerons position on the lisbon treaty is quite untenable
p t i congratulate the commission on the communication it has presented i consider however that the communication should have based its analysis on the conservation of fish stocks and not on vague sustainability
this equilibrium as has been said has been destroyed
given the urgency the council decided to ask the european parliament for an opinion on this proposal in the next session of one thousand seven hundred and twenty one june

regarding frontex i would simply say that the evaluation of the frontex work is in progress and the presidency is planning a more detailed discussion at ministerial level during the conference at the beginning of march when we will talk about frontex and its future and evaluate its work so far
we already know what can and cannot be done
is it because we expect that as time goes by someone the state that is will be able to buy them and make them available for the pleasure of the general public if that were the case there would be a meaning in it
obviously this secondstage draft agreement is a significant breakthrough and is to be welcomed
it is an approach for this century

the report complains that non e u countries produce food to very different production standards thereby exposing eu agricultural products to unequal terms of competition
